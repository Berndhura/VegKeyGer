AAA;;;The <i>Loiseleurio-Vaccinion</i> includes dwarf-shrub vegetation in the alpine belt, where it occurs on wind-swept slopes and ridges with shallow snow cover. The dominating species include <i>Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum</i> s. l., and outside the Czech Republic also <i>Loiseleuria procumbens</i> and <i>Vaccinium gaultherioides.</i> Various arctic-alpine species frequently occur in this vegetation type.
ABA;;;This alliance includes species-poor grasslands of wind-swept habitats in the alpine belt of Scandinavia, the Western Carpathians and the Sudeten Mountains. It is dominated by the graminoids such as <i>Juncus trifidus</i>, <i>Festuca supina</i> and <i>Avenella flexuosa</i>.
ABB;;;This alliance includes species-poor alpine grasslands occurring in habitats with deep, long-lasting snow cover. They are dominated by the tussock-forming grass <i>Nardus stricta</i>. Compared to the grasslands of the <i>Juncion trifidi</i>, this vegetation is confined to flat or slightly concave landforms which are less exposed to wind and support development of closed-canopy grasslands. The geographic range of this alliance includes Scandinavia and the Sudeten Mountains. The <i>Nardus stricta</i> grasslands of the Alps are richer in species and therefore classified within another alliance, the <i>Nardion strictae</i>.
ACA;;;This alliance of alpine basiphilous grassland is endemic to the Krkonoše and Hrubý Jeseník Mountains. It occurs on steep rocky slopes in glacial cirques, where it is confined to outcrops of base-rich rocks, such as crystalline limestone, erlan, porphyrite and basalt.
ADA;;;The alliance <i>Calamagrostion villosae</i> includes subalpine tall grasslands mostly dominated by <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i>, and in places also by <i>Deschampsia cespitosa</i> and <i>Molinia caerulea.</i> This vegetation is confined to nutrient-poorer and more acidic soils than other vegetation types of the class <i>Mulgedio-Aconitetea</i>. In the Czech Republic these species-poor grasslands occur above the timberline in the Krkonoše, Hrubý Jeseník and Králický Sněžník Mountains. <i>Calamagrostion villosae</i> vegetation has also been documented from other European mountains, such as the Alps, Carpathians and Urals.
ADB;;;The alliance <i>Calamagrostion arundinaceae</i> includes species-rich subalpine grasslands dominated by the tussock-forming grass <i>Calamagrostis arundinacea</i> usually occurring on steep south-facing slopes having a pronounced snow cover in winter. Compared with other habitats above the timberline, such slopes are relatively warm both in summer due to insolation and in winter due to the protective effect of snow. This vegetation type is typically developed in glacial cirques of the Hercynian mountain ranges of Central Europe, but has also been reported from the Carpathians and the Urals.
ADC;;;This alliance includes subalpine vegetation dominated by deciduous shrubs or low trees such as <i>Betula carpatica, Salix silesiaca</i> and <i>Sorbus</i> spp. It is distributed in the Hercynian mountain ranges of Central Europe and the Western Carpathians, and correspond to the subalpine scrub with <i>Alnus alnobetula</i> of the Alps and Southern Carpathians. This vegetation usually develops on avalanche tracks in glacial cirques, however in places with less frequent avalanches than is the case for <i>Calamagrostis arundinacea</i> or <i>C. villosa</i> grasslands. Species composition of the herb layer is very similar to that of other alliances of the class <i>Mulgedio-Aconitetea</i>. There is a continuum spanning from tall grasslands through tall grasslands with scattered shrubs to close-canopy shrubberies. We therefore classify this alliance within the class <i>Mulgedio-Aconitetea</i>, although there have been alternative suggestions emphasizing vegetation physiognomy and classifying subalpine dediduous shrubberies as a separate class &ndash; <i>Betulo carpaticae-Alnetea viridis.</i>
ADD;;;The alliance <i>Adenostylion alliariae</i> includes subalpine vegetation of tall broad-leaved forbs and shrubby willows. It occupies wet habitats along mountain streams and in the glacial cirques where soil is well supplied with moisture fed by snowmelts. The soil has a high nutrient status. <i>Adenostylion alliariae</i> vegetation occurs in various mountain ranges of Europe. In the Czech Republic, it is most diverse in the Krkonoše and Hrubý Jeseník Mountains, but some communities are also found in other, lower mountain ranges, where they occasionally descend to the montane belt.
ADE;;;Tall-fern vegetation of the alliance <i>Dryopterido-Athyrion</i> is confined to treeless talus slopes around the timberline. It is found in various mountain ranges of Europe and southern Siberia. In the Czech Republic, it occurs in the Krkonoše, Hrubý Jeseník, Králický Sněžník and Šumava Mountains, where most occurrences are confined to glacial cirques, in particular to leeward slopes with wet soils and distinct winter snow accumulation.
KAA;;;This alliance includes willow scrub dominated or co-dominated by <i>Salix euxina</i>, <i>S. triandra</i> and <i>S. viminalis</i> and other willow species. It is usually 2&ndash;5 m tall and occurs along rivers with slow or intermediate current velocity, which accumulate sandy or loamy sediments.
KAB;;;The alliance <i>Salicion elaeagno-daphnoidis</i> includes shrubby vegetation on gravel beds of montane to submontane braided rivers with fast-flowing water and frequent strong but short floods. It occurs mainly in the Alps and the Carpathians, while it is rare and often fragmentary in the Czech Republic. Dominant species are willows adapted to these habitats, namely <i>Salix elaeagnos</i> and in places also <i>S. daphnoides</i>, <i>Myricaria germanica</i> and in the Alps also <i>Hippophaë rhamnoides</i>.
KAC;;;The alliance <i>Salicion albae</i> comprises open willow and willow-poplar riparian forests dominated by the arborescent species <i>Salix alba</i> and .. <i>euxina</i> as well as their hybrid and in places also <i>Populus nigra</i>. In some places in southern Moravia these stands contain an admixture of <i>P. alba</i>, and occasionally also <i>Fraxinus angustifolia</i>. This vegetation type occurs on deep loamy alluvial soils, usually on sites that are better protected from disturbances by the current than the sites of the <i>Salicion triandrae</i> alliance. They also develop as stages of secondary succession on abandoned flooded meadows and in other wet habitats in the floodplains.
KBA;;;This alliance includes continental drought-adapted vegetation of low-growing shrubs of the genera <i>Prunus</i> and <i>Rosa</i>, and in the eastern European forest-steppe zone also of <i>Caragana</i> and <i>Spiraea</i>. They are usually associated with patches of steppe vegetation, which is reflected in the frequent occurrence of various steppe grasses and broad-leaved herbs.
KBB;;;The alliance <i>Berberidion vulgaris</i> includes temperate European vegetation of dense scrub of 2&ndash;6 m in height, which occurs on dry to mesic soils. Some of the constituent shrub species are thorny or spiny (e.g. <i>Berberis vulgaris</i>, <i>Crataegus</i> spp., <i>Prunus spinosa</i>, <i>Pyrus pyraster</i>, <i>Rhamnus cathartica</i>, <i>Rosa</i> spp. and <i>Rubus</i> spp.). Most of the dominant species also occur in the shrub layer of broad-leaved deciduous forests, while stunted or isolated individuals of trees are often found in shrub-dominated vegetation outside forests. The pattern of herb layer species richness and composition depends on the mosaic of denser and more open patches in the shrub canopy. Vegetation of the <i>Berberidion vulgaris</i> is common in the current Czech landscape. Most stands are secondary, developed at forest edges or as successional stages on abandoned grasslands or arable land. Some small patches of this vegetation on rock outcrops or at natural forest edges in the forest-steppe landscapes are natural.
KBC;;;This alliance includes shrub vegetation of forest clearings, forest canopy openings and disturbed sites in both forested landscapes and man-made habitats. It is dominated by mesic shrub species (especially <i>Lonicera xylosteum</i>, <i>Rubus idaeus</i>, <i>Salix caprea</i> and <i>Sambucus racemosa</i>) and young individuals of fast-growing trees (mainly <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Populus tremula</i> and <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>). It occurs from lowlands to the alpine timberline, being most common at mid-altitudes.
KBD;;;The alliance <i>Aegopodio-Sambucion</i> includes mesophilous and xerophilous shrub vegetation with significant participation of nutrient-demanding and alien species. Besides <i>Sambucus nigra</i>, dominant species of this vegetation include aliens such as <i>Acer negundo</i>, <i>Lycium barbarum</i>, <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i> and <i>Syringa vulgaris</i>. The herb layer is characterized by dominance of ruderal species of both native and alien origin. Several associations dominated by alien shrub species could be distinguished within this alliance, but we recognize only those that are the most common, established for a long time and have developed distinctive habitat affinities in central Europe.
KBE;;;This alliance includes mesic groves of the North American neophyte <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>, which can reach a height of 25 m. <i>Robinia</i> is often the only species in the tree layer, but the shrub layer is usually well developed and can be rich in species. The herb layer is characterized by mesophilous nutrient-demanding ruderal species. In many places distinct synusiae of vernal geophytes and therophytes occur. This alliance is distributed across warm areas of central Europe. In the Czech Republic it occurs at altitudes below 480 m.
KBF;;;This alliance includes woodlands of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> in dry habitats, which have grass-dominated herb layers with <i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i>, <i>Bromus sterilis</i>, <i>Calamagrostis epigejos</i>, <i>Elymus repens</i> and <i>Poa angustifolia</i>. In areas with continental climate such as southern Moravia and south-eastern central Europe thermophilous species including vernal ephemerals and geophytes are well represented.
KBG;;;This alliance includes <i>Robinia</i> scrub and short woodland on dry shallow soils in warm areas. When affected by drought, <i>Robinia</i> becomes competitively weaker and often forms mixed stands with drought-adapted shrubs and trees. The herb layer is characterized by the occurrence of species of dry grasslands, open woodlands and rock outcrops, including vernal therophytes and chamaephytes in addition to the dominant hemicryptophytes.
KCA;;;This alliance includes shrub communities on mineral soils dominated by <i>Pinus mugo</i> in the subalpine belt of the Hercynian mountains, Carpathians, Dinaric and Bulgarian mountains, and also some stands of <i>Pinus mugo</i> in the Eastern Alps. In the Hercynian mountains <i>Pinus mugo</i> scrub occurs on nutrient-poor siliceous rocks, which results in low species richness and predominance of acidophytes in the herb layer. In the Czech Republic natural stands of <i>Pinus mugo</i> are widespread in the Krkonoše Mountains and a few sites occur also in the Šumava Mountains. In addition, <i>Pinus mugo</i> has been planted in some other mountain areas.
LAA;;;This alliance includes vegetation of <i>Alnus glutinosa-</i>dominated forested swamps (carrs), with a herb layer composed of tall sedges and wetland herbs. It develops in shallow waterlogged depressions, in the Czech Republic mainly near fishponds and in broad river floodplains. The <i>Alnus</i> stands are usually even-aged, in most cases developed through overgrowing of open wetlands or fens by <i>Alnus</i>.
LAB;;;This alliance includes willow carrs with <i>Salix aurita</i>, <i>S. cinerea</i>, <i>S. pentandra</i>, <i>Frangula alnus</i> and in some areas also <i>Spiraea salicifolia</i>. The herb layer is usually sparse due to shading by shrubs; it includes species of marshes and wet meadows. This vegetation type occurs in floodplains, near ponds, in wet meadows and at the margins of fens from the lowlands to mountain sites. Its habitats are very similar to those of alder carrs, but usually they are either more recently disturbed or wetter.
LBA;;;The alliance <i>Alnion incanae</i> includes broad-leaved floodplain forests with <i>Alnus incana</i> in the mountains, <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> at mid-altitudes, and the former two species together with <i>Quercus robur</i>, <i>Ulmus laevis</i> and <i>U. minor</i> in the broad floodplains of lowland rivers. In southern Moravia <i>Fraxinus angustifolia</i> can be added to this assemblage, occuring in lowland floodplain forests. Soils of these forests are usually flooded in spring for several days or weeks, but the water table recedes later in the growing season. These soils are rich in nutrients and productive.
LBB;;;The alliance <i>Carpinion betuli</i> includes mesic forests dominated or codominated by hornbeam (<i>Carpinus betulus</i>) and oaks (<i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. and <i>Q. robur</i>). The herb layer is characterized by the predominance of nemoral species, specifically slightly thermophilous, shade-tolerant plants of mesic forests. This alliance is distributed in the temperate zone of Europe from Great Britain and France to Ukraine. Oak-hornbeam forests are better adapted to habitats with summer drought and late frost than beech forests, and are accordingly more common in the continental lowlands and foothill areas of east-central Europe. In central Europe, <i>Carpinus betulus</i> was the last species to colonize in the Holocene migration of forest trees and the extension of its range was probably facilitated by human impact on forests. Most current forests of <i>Carpinion betuli</i> are former coppices that have been transformed into tall forests in the second half of the 20th century.
LBC;;;The alliance <i>Fagion sylvaticae</i> includes climax forests dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> or <i>Abies alba</i>, in places mixed with other trees, especially <i>Picea abies</i> at high altitudes. <i>A. alba</i> would be naturally confined to wet sites, but under past human impact it replaced <i>F. sylvatica</i> in many places. In recent times it has been in decline. The herb layer of these forests is composed of mesophilous and nutrient-demanding species. Soils are mainly cambisols developed on various bedrock types. The range of this alliance extends through the temperate zone of western and central Europe. Towards the east and south-east it is increasingly confined to mountain areas. In the Czech Republic <i>Fagion sylvaticae</i> forests are typical of submontane and montane areas.
LBD;;;This alliance comprises calcicolous and thermophilous forests of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> with a significant role of light-demanding and thermophilous species in the shrub and herb layers. They occur on limestone and other calcareous substrates.
LBE;;;The alliance <i>Luzulo-Fagion sylvaticae</i> includes forests dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> and, less commonly, <i>Abies alba</i>, which occur on nutrient-poor acidic soils over hard siliceous bedrock types. At higher altitudes <i>Picea abies</i> is often present in the tree layer. The shrub layer of these forests is poorly developed and the herb layer is species-poor. In the Czech Republic these forests occur in a broad altitudinal range from 200 to 1200 m, in both the Bohemian Massif and the Carpathians.
LBF;;;The <i>Tilio-Acerion</i> alliance includes azonal forests occurring in ravines, on talus slopes and cliffs, which are composed of the nutrient-demanding trees <i>Acer platanoides</i>, <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i>, <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, <i>Tilia cordata</i>, <i>T. platyphyllos</i> and <i>Ulmus glabra</i>. Limes (<i>Tilia</i> spp.) occur mainly on slightly drier sites, while the others prefer wetter sites. Other tree species typical of adjacent zonal forests can also be found mixed in the tree layer. The shrub and herb layers contain nitrophilous and mesotrophic forest species, frequently including ferns. These forests occur throughout the Czech Republic on various bedrock types and are absent only on mountain summits and in flat lowland regions. Most stands are however of limited extent. They are most common in deep river valleys.
LCA;;;This alliance includes thermophilous oak forests occurring on calcareous bedrock, usually on south-facing slopes. Their tree layer is dominated by <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. or <i>Q. pubescens</i> agg., less frequently also by <i>Q. robur</i>. The shrub and herb layers are well developed, the latter including many species of dry grasslands and dry herbaceous forest fringes, but also species of mesic forests and nitrophilous herbs. This alliance is distributed in the Submediterranean belt of southern France and on the fringes of the Pyrenees, Alps and Carpathians, and in adjacent areas, including the foothills of the Hercynic mountain ranges north of the Alps.
LCB;;;The alliance <i>Aceri tatarici-Quercion</i> includes thermophilous oak forests on base-rich soils in continental areas of east-central and eastern Europe. In the forest-steppe zone of the Ukraine and Russia, these forests are dominated by <i>Quercus robur</i>, but in central Europe also <i>Q. cerris</i>, <i>Q. petraea</i> agg. and <i>Q. pubescens</i> agg. are common constituents of the tree layer. Their herb layer includes a higher number of continental species than in other oak forests, while Submediterranean species are less common. In the Czech Republic this alliance only occurs on gentle slopes or flatland in the dry area of southern Moravia.
LCC;;;This alliance includes thermophilous oak forests growing on acidic to slightly calcareous soils in moderately warm and dry areas. Usually, <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. is the dominant species. In places, <i>Q. robur</i> can dominate as well, whereas <i>Q. pubescens</i> agg. is nearly absent. Central European species as well as species of mesic forests are more common than in the other types of thermophilous oak forests. The range of this alliance is mainly central European, but it also occurs in continental eastern Europe.
LDA;;;In the broad concept of alliances of acidophilous oak forests that we accept here, <i>Quercion roboris</i> is the only alliance of the class <i>Quercetea robori-petraeae</i> in the Czech Republic. It includes species-poor forests of <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. or <i>Q. robur</i>, in places mixed with <i>Betula pendula</i> or <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> on both dry and wet acidic soils<i>.</i> The moss layer is better developed than in most other deciduous forest types.
LEA;;;This alliance comprises open forests of <i>Pinus nigra</i> and <i>P. sylvestris</i> occurring in the Eastern Alps, mainly on limestone or dolomite slopes. They are particularly common in the dry valleys of the Central Alps, but also occur in the Northern and Southern Alps and some adjacent regions. In the Alps they are characterized by the frequent occurrence or dominance of <i>Erica carnea</i> in their herb layer, but in the Czech Republic this species occurs in different vegetation types. The herb layer of these forests includes some continental species and particularly several drought-adapted species typical of limestone areas at the edges of the central European mountain ranges. In the Czech Republic this alliance is found in two relatively dry serpentine areas in the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands.
LFA;;;These pine forests with <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> of north-eastern central and eastern Europe contain boreo-continental taiga species (including <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>) mixed with drought-adapted continental species typical of steppe grasslands. This makes their herb layer richer in species than that of the taiga pine forests belonging to the alliance <i>Dicrano-Pinion sylvestris.</i> Pine forests of the alliance <i>Festuco-Pinion</i> develop on slightly acidic or slightly basic substrates, mainly sand and sandstone.
LFB;;;This alliance comprises forests of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> with a poorly developed shrub layer and species-poor herb layer, which contains acidophilous dwarf shrubs such as <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i> and oligotrophic graminoids and other herbs. The moss layer is well developed. This alliance is distributed across western, central and eastern Europe on nutrient-poor, acidic soils, where deciduous trees are disadvantaged and pine can attain dominance, especially if the stands are occasionally disturbed, e.g. by fires. In the Bohemian Massif, these forests are found on rock outcrops, sandy soils and serpentines.
LFC;;;This alliance comprises zonal climax forests of <i>Picea abies</i> in the supramontane belt of central European mountains as well as natural azonal spruce forests on soils affected by high water table at lower altitudes. <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> is a frequent subcanopy tree in the zonal subtype and <i>Betula pubescens</i> in the azonal one. The herb layer is poor in species, dominated by acidophilous grasses and/or <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>. The moss layer is well developed and rich in species of mosses and hepatics. Soils are acidic and nutrient-poor with a thick layer of poorly decomposed litter. The range of this alliance extends from the mountain areas of central Europe and Scandinavia to the lowlands of eastern Europe.
LFD;;;The alliance <i>Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinion</i> includes peatland forests dominated by <i>Betula pubescens</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> or <i>P. uncinata</i> subsp. <i>uliginosa</i>. Their herb layer contains chamaephytes typical of peatlands (<i>Rhododendron tomentosum</i>, <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> and <i>V. uliginosum</i>), ericoid dwarf shrubs of mesic soils (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>) and acidophilous graminoids typical of both peatlands and mineral soils. The well developed moss layer contains various species of <i>Sphagnum</i> and other peatland mosses as well as bryophytes typical of wet soils. This alliance occurs in peatland complexes across the boreal and temperate zones of Europe. <i>Betula pubescens</i> more frequently dominates in the west of its range, <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> in the east, and <i>Pinus uncinata</i> subsp. <i>uliginosa</i> in the mountain ranges of central Europe.
MAA;;;The alliance <i>Eleocharition ovatae</i> occurs on exposed bottoms of fishponds and fish storage ponds, sediment accumulations along rivers, exposed banks of oxbows, lakes and water reservoirs. The substrate is usually mud, often rich in humus, but also gravel or sand. During seed germination the habitat is saturated with water or flooded by very shallow water, and it slowly dries out. In the period of flowering and seed ripening it is slightly wet or dry near the surface. This alliance is most common in central Europe, particularly in fishpond areas in basins and mid-altitude areas of the Bohemian Massif, but it also occurs in other parts of Eurasia. In the Czech Republic this type of vegetation used to be more common in the past when summer draining of fishponds at regular intervals of a few years was a part of fishpond management.
MAB;;;This vegetation type is most common in man-made habitats, especially wet fields, around persistent puddles on dirt roads, in sand pits, abandoned peat extraction sites, stone quarries and fishpond margins. Substrates are acidic and poor in nutrients. This vegetation requires a high amount of precipitation before, and possibly also during, the growing season of wetland annuals, therefore it is found mainly in the areas of western Europe that are influenced by oceanic climate. In central Europe this vegetation type is mainly found on wet sites in forested areas and near water bodies. In the Czech Republic, it occurs most frequently in the Třeboň basin of southern Bohemia, and scattered localities are also found in some other areas of the Bohemian Massif.
MAC;;;This alliance includes low-growing vegetation of summer or winter annual, or short-lived perenial species, which are weak competitors. It occurs in warm areas, where succession of tall-growing competitors is fast, which means that this vegetation type is most often found in frequently disturbed habitats, such as wet places in arable fields and pastures, sand or loam pits, bottoms of summer-dried fishponds, desiccating oxbows and river banks. Soils are rich in calcium, and on some sites slightly saline. This alliance occurs in warm parts of Europe, being most diverse in the Pannonian region.
MBA;;;The alliance <i>Bidention tripartitae</i> includes stands of annual wetland species belonging to the genera <i>Bidens</i>, <i>Persicaria</i>, <i>Ranunculus</i>, <i>Rumex</i> and <i>Xanthium</i>. These species are usually 50&ndash;150 cm tall and produce large amounts of biomass. They develop on wet, loamy to clayey, nutrient rich substrata. In some places, they replace pioneer vegetation of the class <i>Isoëto-Nano-Juncetea </i>during the course of succession, but often they are the first vegetation type colonizing recently exposed bare wet substrata, especially if they are very rich in nutrients or dry out quickly. This alliance is distributed across Eurasia and North America.
MBB;;;This alliance includes vegetation dominated by annual species of <i>Atriplex </i>and <i>Chenopodium</i>, which develops on slightly saline and ammonium-rich soils around dung hills and in places with agricultural waste water input, often near barns. They also occur on sediment accumulations along large rivers and on exposed bottoms of nutrient-rich fishponds. These substrates are usually rich in calcium and magnesium. The <i>Chenopodion rubri </i>alliance occurs in Europe and some parts of central Asia.
MCA;;;Marshes of the alliance <i>Phragmition australis </i>include monodominant stands of tall grasses and other grass-like plants, which spread both clonally through rhizomes as well as by seed. This reed vegetation occurs in the littoral zones of lentic and lotic wetlands. Most of the dominant species have firm and flexible stems, which are resistant to disturbances by wave action and strong wind; they can therefore form a fringe even around large water bodies. This vegetation type is distributed across Europe and is also found on other continents.
MCB;;;This alliance includes inland continental brackish marshes of vernal pools or shallow water bodies dominated by <i>Bolboschoenus maritimus. B. planiculmis</i> and <i>Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani</i>. It occurs in depressions, ditches and channels in areas with base-rich bedrock or near mineral springs. During dry summers the water table continuously decreases and eventually the habitat can dry out. The vegetation types assigned to this alliance are distributed in warm and dry areas of central and eastern Europe, especially in the Pannonian Basin.
MCC;;;This alliance includes vegetation types dominated by perennial or biennial wetland herbs such as <i>Alisma</i>, <i>Butomus</i>, <i>Oenanthe</i>, <i>Rorippa </i>and <i>Sagittaria</i>, or graminoids. They occur in habitats with periodical changes of water level, typically in shallow littoral zones or in fishponds in the years following water drawdowns. Many species regenerate from seed or vegetatively on exposed bottoms, and develop maximum biomass if the period of exposure is followed by a period of shallow flooding. Some species typical of this vegetation have adapted to water level fluctuations by developing dimorphic leaves, with different morphologies produced in submerged and emergent conditions. These vegetation types usually occur in habitats of short duration and soon decline due to either deeper flooding or succession of tall marshes. This alliance is widespread in the temperate zone of Eurasia, with some occurrences in the boreal zone, and has also been recorded in the Americas.
MCD;;;This alliance includes reed and tall-sedge vegetation along middle river courses in colline and submontane areas, frequently dominated by <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>, less frequently <i>Carex buekii </i>and <i>Calamagrostis pseudophragmites</i>. It occurs on gravelly, sandy or loamy-sandy alluvial sediments on river banks or on islets in river channels. It is frequently disturbed by brief flooding.
MCE;;;The alliance Glycerio-Sparganion includes vegetation of short marshes or dense carpet-like stands, which may float on the water surface. Stand sizes tend to be small. This vegetation occurs on fluvial fine-grained accumulations of brooks or small rivers, in drainage ditches, fish storage ponds, and littoral zones of fishponds. The dominant species are weak competitors, and correspondingly occur on frequently disturbed sites; if undisturbed, they are usually outcompeted by tall reed vegetation. This alliance has a Eurasian distribution.
MCF;;;This alliance includes vegetation of tall to short wetland graminoids or broad-leaved herbs occurring on wet, organic muddy sediments. They produce creeping stolons, rhizomes and adventitious roots, which ensure their stability in the unstable substrate, and also allow formation of carpet-like stands floating on the water surface. The vegetation types treated within this alliance occur in mesotrophic or dystrophic, rarely also eutrophic habitats, in an advanced stage of terrestrialization. They are typical of fishpond littoral zones, especially on peat accumulations, oxbows, alluvial pools, ditches and peatlands. These habitats have a relatively stable water level, without floods that bring in mineral sediment accumulation. The water table is usually up to 50 cm high though it can recede far enough to expose the bottom, but the substrate never dries up. <i>Carici-Rumicion hydrolapathi </i>is typical of the boreal zone of Eurasia and of oceanic north-western Europe, and has scattered occurrences in the temperate zone.
MCG;;;This alliance encompasses marsh vegetation dominated by tall sedges, which form high tussocks in some cases. Tussocky stands tend to be species-richer than those in which stoloniferous sedges dominate. Communities of the <i>Magno-Caricion elatae </i>occupy fishpond littoral zones and depressions in mire complexes supplied with nutrient-poor water. Water table is more stable than in the alliance <i>Magno-Caricion gracilis</i>; it is above the soil surface over the most of the growing season. Because of their sensitivity to eutrophication, all associations of this alliance have became rare, except the association <i>Equiseto-Caricetum rostratae</i>, which is still rather common.
MCH;;;The alliance <i>Magno-Caricion gracilis</i> includes marshes dominated by tall wetland graminoids such as the rhizomatous sedges <i>Carex acuta</i>, <i>C. acutiformis</i>, <i>C. disticha. C. riparia</i>, <i>C. vesicaria </i>and <i>C. vulpina</i>, the cespitose sedge <i>C. paniculata</i>, and a rhizomatous grass, <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>á. The stands are usually species-poor due to the high cover of dominant species. Vegetation belonging to this alliance occurs in shallow littoral zones of fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools, depressions in wet meadows and on banks of lentic river sections. In the course of terrestrialization it usually replaces reed vegetation of the alliance <i>Phragmition australis</i>. Vegetation of the <i>Magno-Caricion gracilis </i>generally occurs in nutrient-richer habitats and at lower altitudes than that of the <i>Magno-Caricion elatae</i>. It is distributed across Europe and in some parts of Asia.
RAA;;;This alliance includes vegetation of forest springs over acidic to slightly alkaline bedrock. The herb layer is well developed. The cover of the moss layer varies according to the frequency of disturbances and the degree of canopy opening. The herb layer is mostly dominated by <i>Cardamine amara </i>subsp. <i>amara </i>et <i>austriaca. Carex remota. C. sylvatica. Chrysosplenium alternifolium. C. oppositifolium </i>and<i> Petasites albus</i>, which are accompanied by mesophilous forest species. The vegetation of this alliance occurs in beech, oak-hornbeam and wet spruce forests or in alder carrs. It occupies gravelly or muddy soils which are supplied by ground water with stable temperature throughout the year.
RAB;;;This alliance includes vegetation developing on calcium-rich springs under forest canopies, often with intensive precipitation of calcium carbonate. Bryophytes strongly predominate over vascular plants.
RAC;;;This alliance includes well-insolated spring vegetation supplied by slowly moving water with acidic to neutral reaction and low calcium content. This vegetation type is characterized by its well-developed moss layer. The herb layer is dominated by species of the genus <i>Montia</i>. The range of this alliance includes western and central Europe, where it occurs on open springs below the timberline.
RAD;;;This alliance includes well-insolated spring vegetation in the subalpine and alpine belts on nutrient-poor siliceous bedrock. It is dominated by bryophytes such as <i>Dichodontium palustre. Philonotis seriata </i>and <i>Pohlia wahlenbergii</i>. It occurs in subalpine to alpine areas across Europe.
RBA;;;This alliance includes vegetation in calcareous fens with low primary productivity, composed mostly of short sedges and bryophytes. The fens are fed by ground water and occur either around sloping springs or in areas of seepage in valleys. Calcicole species prevail and <i>Sphagnum </i>mosses do not occur at all because of high pH, calcium and hydrogencarbonate content. Substrates can be either organic peat or, more often, mineral sediments such as calcareous tufa, marl or lacustrine chalk. In sediments rich in calcium carbonate, limitation by available phosphorus and iron strongly affects species composition. In the most water-saturated fens with deep peat layers, some tall sedges with boreal distribution may occur. Some calcareous fens originated already in the late glacial and may have persisted through forested stages of the Holocene, at least in small patches. Some other localities originated after forest clearing in modern times. This vegetation type has a large proportion of specialists and is often dominated by some of them. It is strongly endangered due to habitat destruction, drainage and eutrophication. The decline of traditional mowing practices, which may balance the effects of slight drainage and slight increase in nutrient avaliability, contributes to loss of these fens. The geographical range of this alliance includes temperate Europe.
RBB;;;This alliance includes species-rich vegetation with calcicolous species, calcium-tolerant peat mosses (e.g. <i>Sphagnum contortum. S. teres </i>and <i>S. warnstorfii</i>), species with boreal distribution and shallow-rooting acidophytes. It can occur on old, deep peat sediments, as well as in initial phases of peat formation and on fen grasslands that are cut periodically for low-quality hay. It can also develop from calcareous fens of the alliance <i>Caricion davallianae</i> through autogenic succession associated with peat accumulation and consequent decrease of water table. The habitat is fed by ground water with intermediate pH and calcium content. Outside the Czech Republic, the alliance also includes moss communities with a sparse herb layer, as well as fen woodlands with coniferous trees. That the latter habitat also existed in our region in the late glacial has been confirmed using the fossil record. This alliance contains a large proportion of specialists, endangered species and species considered to be glacial relicts. It occurs across the Eurasian and North American boreal zone and in the mountain ranges of temperate Europe.
RBC;;;This alliance includes moderately rich fens without the calcicolous species typical of the alliance<i> Caricion davallianae</i>, but still rather species-rich and containing species that avoid extremely acidic habitats. Stands are dominated by short sedges, grasses, dicots and by <i>Sphagnum </i>species from the sections <i>Subsecunda</i> and <i>Squarrosa</i>. Non-sphagnaceous mosses (e.g. <i>Aulacomnium palustre. Calliergonella cuspidata</i> or<i> Warnstorfia exannulata</i>) may also occur and even dominate on some sites. The most acidic poor fens dominated by species of <i>Sphagnum </i>sect. <i>Cuspidata</i> are not included in this alliance. Habitats include managed fen grasslands, fens at fishpond margins and subalpine spring fens. The habitats are fed by ground water which is richer in nutrients than in other alliances of the class <i>Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae</i>. The alliance occurs in most European countries.
RBD;;;This alliance includes poor acidic fens, which are fed mostly by ground water, but calcium concentrations are low. However, nutrient availability is better than in ombrotrophic bogs. The vegetation is dominated by species of <i>Sphagnum </i>sect. <i>Cuspidata </i>or <i>Polytrichum commune </i>in the moss layer, and by short (<i>Carex echinata </i>and <i>C. nigra</i>) or tall (<i>C. lasiocarpa </i>and <i>C. rostrata</i>) sedges. Acidophilous species prevail in this kind of vegetation and some species of ombrotrophic bogs can also be present. The alliance is widely distributed on calcium-poor bedrock and includes young, managed fen grasslands, fens at fishpond and lake margins and bog laggs. It may develop through a process of autogenic succession from vegetation of the alliances <i>Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis </i>and <i>Caricion canescenti-nigrae</i>. The range of this alliance probably includes northern, western and central Europe.
RBE;;;This alliance includes species-poor communities of dystrophic bog hollows co-dominated by <i>Carex limosa. C. rostrata</i>, <i>Eriophorum angustifolium </i>and <i>Scheuchzeria palustris</i>. The herb layer is sparse, but bryophytes can reach cover values up to 100%. In areas of air pollution some <i>Sphagnum</i> species can be substituted by hepatics (e.g. <i>Gymnocolea inflata</i>) and algae. Bog hollows are maintained by the action of frost and water input from precipitation. This alliance is distributed in the boreal zone of northern Europe and mountainous areas of central Europe, but rarely it occurs also at lower altitudes in central and western Europe.
RCA;;;This alliance includes species-poor vegetation of both open and wooded bogs in continental to subcontinental areas. Communities are dominated by hummock-forming <i>Sphagnum </i>species, small shrubs and species of <i>Cyperaceae</i>. Open bog vegetation is restricted to deep peat with a stable water regime and to suboceanic regions with high precipitation, whereas wooded bog vegetation is more common on shallow peat with fluctuating water level. Wooded bogs are characterized by a semi-open canopy made up of <i>Pinus </i>species, more rarely by <i>Picea abies </i>and<i> Betula </i>species.
RCB;;;This alliance includes bog vegetation without a hollow-hummock structure in areas with high precipitation and relatively stable temperature throughout the year. It predominantly occurs in oceanic to suboceanic areas. In central Europe, this vegetation reaches its eastern distribution limit, and lacks several suboceanic species which are common in western Europe.
RCC;;;This alliance includes boreal bog vegetation with isolated occurrences in the supramontane to subalpine belt of the central European mountain ranges. It occurs in bogs in precipitation-rich areas with low temperatures and short growing seasons, characterized by the occurrence of boreo-arctic species such as <i>Betula nana. Oxycoccus microcarpus </i>and <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i>. In central Europe these species are rare, and transitional stands to the alliance <i>Sphagnion magellanici </i>are more common than typical stands.
SAA;;;This alliance includes calcicolous vegetation on limestone cliffs or outcrops of other calcareous rocks. It can also occur on walls which contain calcium in mortar. Typical species are the calcicole ferns <i>Asplenium ruta-muraria </i>and<i> Gymnocarpium robertianum </i>and those with a broader tolerance to calcium content, such as <i>Asplenium trichomanes </i>and<i> Cystopteris fragilis</i>. Unlike on siliceous rocks, these habitats host more nutrient-demanding, in some cases ruderal species.
SAB;;;<i>Asplenion cuneifolii </i>includes vegetation of serpentine rock outcrops. Serpentine is an ultramafic rock with high content of magnesium and heavy metals, which exert toxic influence on many plant species. Some ferns are confined to this habitat, namely <i>Asplenium adulterinum </i>and<i> A. cuneifolium</i>. The southern European fern species <i>Notholaena marantae</i>, which reaches its northern limits in central Europe, also rarely occurs on serpentine outcrops in warm areas of this region. In the Czech Republic, occurrences of serpentine are found in small patches in different areas of the Bohemian Massif. Along with specialist ferns, serpentine outcrops host mainly species from the adjacent forests or grasslands: in precipitation-rich areas, most of these are calcifuge species, while in drier areas, calcicoles strongly prevail.
SAC;;;This alliance includes vegetation of outcrops of a variety of different rock types, with the exception of strongly calcareous rocks and serpentine. Of the species confined to rock crevices, there are specialists of acidic substrata (e.g. <i>Asplenium septentrionale. A. trichomanes </i>subsp. <i>trichomanes </i>and<i> Woodsia ilvensis</i>) as well as species tolerant of a broad range of substrate pH (e.g. <i>Cystopteris fragilis </i>and<i> Polypodium vulgare</i>). The suite of other species mainly depends on the vegetation types occurring in the surroundings of the outcrops and the degree of shading, which can vary from fully exposed to deeply shaded under a forest canopy.
SAD;;;This is an open vegetation type of stable screes of siliceous rocks. It occurs in the montane to alpine belts of high mountain ranges of northern, north-western and central Europe and of the Balkans.
SBA;;;<i>Cymbalario-Asplenion </i>is an alliance of wall vegetation of central and western Europe, which combines species of <i>Asplenietea trichomanis </i>(e.g., small ferns) with diagnostic species of the <i>Cymbalario-Parietarietea</i>. However, the latter are mostly aliens of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origin that are common on both rocks and walls in their primary range but are confined to walls in their secondary range in the north-west. Accompanying species include those of European or Eurasian distribution, often with a ruderal life strategy. This species composition places <i>Cymbalario-Asplenion </i>in a transitional position between the classes <i>Asplenietea trichomanis </i>and <i>Cymbalario-Parietarietea</i>.
SCA;;;This alliance includes vegetation of mobile screes on limestone or other base-rich substrata such as calcareous shale or volcanic rocks. Its range includes the Alps, the Carpathians and the submediterranean zone of Europe. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type occurs rarely in the warm and dry to moderately dry areas.
SCB;;;The alliance<i> Galeopsion </i>includes vegetation of mobile screes of acidic to neutral rocks in colline to submontane areas. Its range extends over the subatlantic part of western Europe, the Hercynian mountain ranges of central Europe, the Alps and the Carpathians.
TAA;;;This alliance of saline annual grasslands on exposed bottoms of lakes and pools is widespread in south-eastern Europe. It reaches its north-western distribution limit in southern Moravia. In the past this vegetation was probably widespread around southern Moravian saline lakes before these were drained and converted to agricultural land in the 19th century. Today, only a few remnants are encountered.
TBA;;;This alliance includes inland vegetation of annual succulent halophytes such as <i>Salicornia prostrata</i> and <i>Suaeda prostrata</i>. It occurs on strongly saline, loamy or clayey soils. In the past it was found at several sites in dry areas of southern Moravia, but today this vegetation has been destroyed and both dominant species are extinct in the Czech Republic.
TCA;;;This alliance includes species-poor, saline grasslands dominated by short grasses of the genus <i>Puccinellia</i>, occurring <i></i>on drier soils than the other vegetation types of saline habitats. It is distributed in dry lowlands of south-eastern-central and south-eastern Europe, where it is often found in contact with steppe vegetation. In southern Moravia it reaches its north-western distribution limits.
TCB;;;Saline grasslands of the alliance <i>Juncion gerardii</i> are more closed and moister than those of the <i>Puccinellion limosae</i>. Physiognomically they resemble mesic pastures or ruderal grasslands influenced by grazing and trampling. They are distributed across temperate Europe from the precipitation-rich areas near the Atlantic coast to the continental parts of Russia. In the Czech Republic they are found in dry areas of northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
TDA;;;The alliance <i>Arrhenatherion elatioris</i> includes the most common types of mesic Central European meadows, occurring on gentle slopes or non-flooded river terraces. They are used for hay-making, usually mown twice a year, with occasional aftermath grazing in some places. This alliance is most common in Central Europe, but it also occurs in other regions of temperate Europe.
TDB;;;The alliance <i>Polygono-Trisetion</i> includes mesic montane meadows on nutrient-rich soils. These are usually dominated by medium-tall grasses. In addition to species typical of meadows they also contain some species of forests and subalpine tall-forb vegetation. Due to the less favourable montane climate, <i>Polygono-Trisetion</i> meadows are less productive than those of the alliance <i>Arrhenatherion elatioris</i>. Therefore they are less intensively managed, being mown once or twice a year. These meadows occur in various mountain ranges of temperate Europe, becoming progressively more common in oceanic areas.
TDC;;;The alliance <i>Cynosurion cristati</i> includes mesic pastures and disturbed perennial grasslands of trampled or frequently cut sites. Soils are well supplied with nutrients, enabling fast regeneration of plants after disturbance. In addition to species shared with mesic meadows, <i>Cynosurion cristati</i> pastures contain more unpalatable and disturbance-adapted species. Depending on management, <i>Cynosurion cristati</i> pastures may change into <i>Arrhenatherion elatioris</i> meadows and <i>vice versa</i>. The geographic range of this alliance is probably very similar with that of the class of <i>Molinio-Arrhenatheretea</i>, including the entire temperate zone of Europe and some adjacent regions.
TDD;;;The alliance <i>Molinion caeruleae</i> includes meadows on nutrient-poor soils that are wet but not flooded in spring and mesic in summer. In many stands the dominant species are the tussock-forming grasses <i>Molinia arundinacea</i> or <i>M. caerulea</i>. Species of intermittently wet soils, shared with open forests, are frequent. Due to their lower productivity, these meadows are usually mown only once a year, usually later in the season than other types of meadows. This alliance is widespread in the temperate zone of Europe, but in recent decades many stands have disappeared due to abandonment, drainage or fertilization.
TDE;;;The alliance <i>Deschampsion cespitosae</i> includes meadows of broad floodplains which are regularly flooded in spring. Due to natural fertilization by floods, these meadows are highly productive and therefore they were usually mown three times a year in the past. After retreat of spring floods, water table usually decreases to far below ground, especially in dry lowlands, and the soils become dry in late summer. These meadows are distributed across temperate Europe, but they contain more species of continental distribution adapted to summer drought towards the eastern regions.
TDF;;;The <i>Calthion palustris</i> wet meadows are dominated by broad-leaved tall forbs, especially species of the genus <i>Cirsium</i>. They occur in floodplains or around springs on rather wet, nutrient-rich soils and in habitats experiencing shallow spring floods. Although the ground water table usually decreases slightly in dry periods in summer, soils never dry out completely. The <i>Calthion palustris</i> meadows are most frequent in precipitation-rich areas at higher altitudes, but may also occur at water-logged sites with impeded draining in the lowlands. The typical <i>Calthion palustris</i> meadows are regularly mown, while abandoned stands are quickly overgrown by broad-leaved tall forbs such as <i>Filipendula ulmaria.</i> This alliance is widespread in oceanic and suboceanic regions of temperate Europe; scattered occurrences were recorded also from subcontinental Europe.
TEA;;;The alliance <i>Nardion strictae</i> typifies grasslands dominated by <i>Nardus stricta</i> occurring in higher mountain ranges. Some stands are natural grasslands occurring around the timberline, while others are found at deforested sites below the timberline. They contain some species of alpine grasslands and subalpine tall-forb vegetation. The distribution range of this alliance includes various mountain ranges of western and Central Europe.
TEB;;;The alliance <i>Nardo-Agrostion</i> includes grasslands of <i>Nardus stricta</i> which develop at deforested sites of the montane belt in the high mountain ranges which possess a well-defined alpine belt. The stands of the <i>Nardo-Agrostion</i> contain a mixture of species from different altitudinal belts, including both the alpine and submontane grassland species pools. This alliance is distributed in the Carpathians and probably also in the Alps. In the Czech Republic, well developed stands occur only in the Krkonoše Mountains.
TEC;;;This alliance includes grasslands with <i>Nardus stricta</i> and other oligotrophic grasses occurring on nutrient-poor and moderately dry soils. It is distributed from the lowland areas to the montane belt in western and Central Europe.
TED;;;This alliance includes low-growing oligotrophic grasslands on wet soils, dominated by <i>Juncus squarrosus</i> and <i>Nardus stricta</i>. They are common in precipitation-rich regions of western and north-western Europe, reaching their eastern distribution limits in Central Europe.
TEE;;;The alliance <i>Euphorbio-Callunion</i> typifies vegetation of dry heathlands dominated by <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> occurring on acidic and nutrient-poor soils in lowland and colline landscapes characterized by low rainfall. Often they are in contact with dry grasslands and contain some steppe species. Drought-adapted mosses and lichens are common in the stands. The range of this alliance includes drier areas in lowlands of eastern Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia.
TEF;;;This alliance includes heathlands with <i>Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i> confined to sites without pronounced summer drought and with continuous snow cover in winter, which has a frost-protective effect. Like other heathlands, they occupy acidic, nutrient-poor soils. This alliance is distributed in the Hercynian mountain ranges of western and Central Europe. It may form either the natural vegetation of rock outcrops and areas above the timberline, or secondary vegetation on deforested sites.
TFA;;;The alliance <i>Corynephorion canescentis</i> typifies open vegetation of inland sand dunes, dominated by the perennial tussock-forming grass <i>Corynephorus canescens.</i> Sand in such habitats is acidic and free of calcium carbonate, with very low humus content and low nutrient status. Vegetation is disturbed by aeolian re-distribution of sand, and in many places by human activities. If left undisturbed for several years, dunes become consolidated, resulting in the replacement of the open <i>Corynephorus</i> grasslands by more closed <i>Festuca</i> grasslands. The distribution range of the <i>Corynephorion canescentis</i> includes temperate Europe from East Anglia to the Ukraine, however, the alliance is most common in areas with suboceanic climate, especially in the lowlands from northern France through northern Germany to Poland.
TFB;;;The alliance <i>Thero-Airion</i> comprises open low-growing therophytic vegetation of recently disturbed sites on sand or gravel, usually dominated by annual grasses of the genera <i>Aira</i> and <i>Vulpia</i>. It is most common in suboceanic areas of north-western Europe, but becomes increasingly rare towards the south-eastern regions.
TFC;;;This alliance includes sand grasslands dominated by tussock-forming, narrow-leaved species of the genus <i>Festuca,</i> in particular <i>F. brevipila</i> and <i>F. ovina</i>. In the successional series of sand grasslands, they follow the initial vegetation of the <i>Corynephorion canescentis</i> on moving dunes. They develop on consolidated sandy soils with higher humus and fine soil particle content. The vegetation of this alliance is found in sandy areas of the Central European lowlands, most commonly in northern Germany and Poland.
TFD;;;This alliance includes open, drought-adapted vegetation occurring on outcrops of base-poor siliceous rocks, such as granite, gneiss or slate in colline to submontane altitudinal belt. It is distributed in the Hercynian mountains of Central Europe and in the Carpathians.
TFE;;;This alliance includes open vegetation of short-lived vernal therophytes, succulents, bryophytes and lichens on shallow soils adjacent to siliceous rock outcrops. It is widespread in warm and dry colline landscapes of Central Europe.
TFF;;;This alliance encompasses communities of vernal therophytes and succulents occurring on base-rich rock outcrops, especially limestone, and in disturbed places within limestone grasslands. It is distributed in warm and dry areas on the fringes of a number of western, central and south-eastern European mountain ranges.
TGA;;;The alliance <i>Festucion vaginatae</i> comprises vegetation of the Pannonian sand steppe, usually dominated by the tussock-forming, narrow-leaved grass <i>Festuca vaginata</i>. It is most common in the Great Hungarian Plain and adjacent lowlands.
THA;;;The alliance <i>Alysso-Festucion pallentis</i> includes thermophilous perennial vegetation of rock outcrops, usually dominated by the narrow-leaved tussock-forming grass <i>Festuca pallens</i>. It is found on south-facing slopes on both acidic rocks and limestone in dry colline landscapes and upland fringes of Central Europe north of the Alps.
THB;;;This alliance encompasses dry grasslands of limestone and dolomite outcrops in the Pannonian floristic region. These grasslands are often dominated by <i>Festuca pallens</i> and contain a number of species of submediterranean distribution and some endemics of the limestone fringes of the Eastern Alps and the Western Carpathians. This alliance is found in colline landscapes at the edge of the Carpathian Basin. It is vicarious to the alliance <i>Xero-Bromion</i> of south-western Central Europe.
THC;;;This is grassland vegetation dominated by <i>Sesleria caerulea</i>, occurring on north-facing cliffs and rocky slopes in warm and dry areas of Central Europe. It contains a mixture of thermophilous species of dry grasslands and dealpine species, which were probably widespread on base-rich substrata of the lowlands during the last Ice Age, but have largely retreated to higher altitudes of the Alps and Carpathians in the Holocene.
THD;;;The alliance <i>Festucion valesiacae</i> includes vegetation of continental steppes, dominated by narrow-leaved tussock-forming grasses of the genera <i>Festuca</i> and <i>Stipa.</i> Stands of this alliance occupy south-facing slopes in the warmest and driest areas of Central Europe. They are supported by soils developing usually over base-rich and often calcareous bedrocks. These grasslands are distributed in Russian and Ukrainian steppes as well as in dry areas of south-eastern and Central Europe. At several sites in Central Europe they are relicts of continental steppe, which used to be widespread at low altitudes in the Late Glacial. At many sites these grasslands persisted continuously throughout the Holocene, due to extremely dry local conditions or grazing. Elsewhere the communities of the <i>Festucion valesiacae</i> are of secondary nature, developed after deforestation of semi-dry woodlands. Return of woody vegetation in these secondary dry grasslands after cessation of grazing is retarded or completely prevented by drought.
THE;;;This alliance includes semi-dry grasslands dominated by <i>Brachypodium pinnatum</i> and <i>Bromus erectus</i>. Unlike the physiognomically similar grasslands of the alliance <i>Bromion erecti</i>, they contain several continental species typical of eastern European meadow steppes. Many stands are very rich in species. These grasslands occur on deeper, calcareous soils in warm and dry areas of Central Europe. At some sites they may be relicts of primary meadow steppes in forest-steppe vegetation complexes, while at other sites they may have developed as a secondary vegetation replacing former oak or oak-hornbeam forests. Traditionally these grasslands were extensively grazed or mown for hay. Today traditional use has been abandoned in many stands, but at some localities mowing has been re-introduced as a conservation measure.
THF;;;This alliance includes semi-dry grasslands of suboceanic distribution which lack several species of submediterranean or continental distribution. It occurs mainly in the western part of Central Europe and in areas of western Europe with subcontinental climate. The <i>Bromion erecti</i> grasslands form secondary vegetation types at sites of potential beech or oak-hornbeam forests. The dominating species of these mostly closed grasslands are usually <i>Brachypodium pinnatum</i> or <i>Bromus erectus</i>, the former being favoured by grazing or short-term abandonment, the latter by mowing, respectively. The stands that have been lightly grazed or mown can be very rich in species, however, they can be quickly invaded by shrubs and trees after abandonment.
THG;;;The alliance <i>Koelerio-Phleion phleoidis</i> includes dry grasslands on acidic soils developed over granite, gneiss and other siliceous bedrock types. Its species composition has transitional features linking dry grasslands of the alliances <i>Festucion valesiacae</i> and <i>Bromion erecti</i>, and sand grasslands of <i>Armerion elongatae.</i> These grasslands are mainly found in dry areas, since in wetter areas (usually at higher altitudes) dry grassland species tend to avoid acidic soils. In the past, these grasslands were used for low-intensity grazing. The distribution range of this alliance includes dry regions of Central Europe.
THH;;;The alliance <i>Geranion sanguinei</i> includes thermophilous herbaceous vegetation dominated by broad-leaved herbs in which species of dry grasslands and of the understorey of open oak forests grow together. This vegetation is mostly found in ecotonal situations where dry grasslands border thermophilous oak forests or xeric shrub vegetation; it may also develop from a dry grassland after abandonment. It may be either a part of natural zonation in forest-steppe vegetation complexes or vegetation developed in human-created ecotones. The <i>Geranion sanguinei</i> fringe vegetation is mainly found in warm areas of northern, central and eastern Bohemia and southern Moravia.
THI;;;The alliance <i>Trifolion medii</i> includes herbaceous vegetation with broad-leaved herbs which is typical of ecotonal sites in moderately warm and moderately dry areas throughout the Czech Republic. Its species composition indicates more mesic conditions when compared to the <i>Geranion sanguinei</i>. This vegetation type is mainly associated with oak-hornbeam forests, thermophilous types of beech forests, and related scrub.
VAA;;;This is structurally simple, species-poor vegetation of tiny, free-floating aquatic plants such as lemnids, aquatic ferns and liverworts. It occurs in different types of natural and artificial water bodies, including intermittent pools and puddles. It quickly regenerates after disturbance or if a water body has dried up. Individual plants spread quickly between different water bodies in the landscape with migrating waterfowl and in fishing nets.
VAB;;;This alliance includes submerged, free-floating vegetation of bladderworts, Utricularia australis and U. vulgaris, in mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic shallow water bodies. Larger stands are developed only in clear water which does not dry out in summer, or in habitats in which the bottom is exposed only for a short time and complete substrate desiccation does not occur. This vegetation thus occurs mainly in precipitation-rich areas. In the past decades occurrences of this vegetation type in fishponds has declined, but it has become newly established in other types of man-made water bodies such as pools in abandoned sand pits.
VAC;;;This alliance includes vegetation of free-floating macrophytes, which are much larger than those dominating in the other alliances of the class <i>Lemnetea</i>. It occurs in shallow water bodies in an advanced stage of terrestrialization. Due to limited incidence of floods in the floodplains of regulated rivers, shallow alluvial water bodies dry out or terrestrialize quickly, and some associations of this alliance are in decline.
VBA;;;The alliance <i>Nymphaeion albae </i>includes vegetation dominated by large dicot aquatic macrophytes which are rooted in the bottom and have leaf rosettes or individual leaves floating on the water surface. Most of the dominant species have large insect-pollinated flowers. This vegetation occurs in shallow water bodies with oligo-mesotrophic to eutrophic, still or slow-moving water in temperate and boreal zones. In the succession series of aquatic macrophyte vegetation, it replaces vegetation of submerged macrophytes, and its large biomass production contributes to rapid terrestrialization.
VBB;;;This alliance includes aquatic vegetation dominated by various species of <i>Potamogeton</i>, and in some cases also of <i>Elodea. Groenlandia. Myriophyllum. Najas </i>and <i>Zannichellia</i>. Most of them have narrow submerged leaves or leaflets, although some have large entire leaves, which are either submerged or with blades floating on the water surface. Biomass produced by this vegetation type is smaller than that produced by the <i>Nymphaeion albae </i>vegetation, although quite often the dominant species occupies the entire water column. Dominant species of the <i>Potamion </i>communities have small inconspicuous flowers, either water-pollinated or emerging above the water surface and pollinated by wind.
VBC;;;The alliance Batrachion fluitantis includes vegetation dominated by different species of Batrachium (Ranunculus subgen. Batrachium), Callitriche, and other submerged aquatic macrophytes adapted to fast running water, usually with fluctuating water table and restricted availability of nutrients. These species have roots or rhizomes firmly anchored in the bottom, elastic and firm stems, and leaves with blades divided into long narrow parts. Some species also have leaves floating on the water surface. Besides generative reproduction, the species often spread through vegetative fragments. This vegetation occurs mainly in the upper and middle sections of rivers or in larger brooks, but also in some clean still water bodies. It is typical of north-western to central Europe, while in south-eastern Europe it is less diverse or absent due to higher temperatures and better nutrient status of streams.
VBD;;;The alliance <i>Ranunculion aquatilis </i>includes aquatic vegetation of shallow, often periodical, still or slowly moving water with significant fluctuations of water table during the season. In summer water table can drop below the level of the bottom in some habitats. Dominant species can occur in different growth forms depending on water depth. They include various species of <i>Batrachium</i>, <i>Callitriche</i>, and <i>Hottonia palustris</i>. Depending on water depth, the dominant species are accompanied by various aquatic or wetland plants. This vegetation occurs mainly in natural habitats such as alluvial pools and oxbows, but it may also occur in man-made habitats if they are in an early successional stage or affected by frequent disturbance, which limits otherwise competitively stronger species of aquatic macrophytes. The alliance <i>Ranunculion aquatilis </i>is most common and diverse in north-western and central Europe and becomes increasingly rare towards the south and east.
VCA;;;This alliance includes submerged vegetation dominated by species of the genus <i>Nitella </i>and <i>Chara braunii</i>, i.e. species without calcareous incrustation. It occurs in calcium-poor, acidic to neutral water. It is most common in western Europe and becomes increasingly rare towards the east. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in cool and wet areas of the western part of the country.
VCB;;;This alliance includes stands dominated by various species of <i>Chara </i>and <i>Tolypella</i> that are characterized by calcium carbonate incrustations of their thallus and occurrence in calcium-rich water. In contrast to the alliance <i>Nitellion flexilis</i>, this alliance is more common in continental areas and in man-made habitats.
VDA;;;This alliance includes vegetation dominated by <i>Isoëtes echinospora </i>or <i>I. lacustris</i>, which occurs in oligotrophic non-calcareous lakes of boreal-arctic regions of Europe and North America and of humid areas of central and eastern Europe. In the Czech Republic this vegetation occurs in two lakes in the Šumava Mountains.
VDB;;;The alliance <i>Eleocharition acicularis </i>includes vegetation of low-growing amphibious perennial plants such as <i>Eleocharis acicularis</i>, <i>Juncus bulbosus</i>, <i>Littorella.uniflora </i>and <i>Pilularia globulifera</i>, and to a lesser extent species with swimming leaves such as <i>Luronium natans</i>. These species often form monospecific stands, especially during periods of flooding. Vegetation of the <i>Eleocharition acicularis </i>occurs mainly in oligotrophic to mesotrophic, lentic wetlands. Due to limited nutrient availibility it grows slowly, and under eutrophication it usually declines due to the spread of competitively stronger species. Its diversity is high in the oceanic parts of Europe and decreases towards continental areas. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in fishponds in precipitation-rich areas with acidic bedrock.
VDC;;;The alliance<i> Sphagno-Utricularion </i>includes species-poor vegetation of shallow bog pools, dominated by the bladderworts <i>Utricularia intermedia. U. minor. U. ochroleuca</i>, and at a single site in the Czech Republic by <i>U. bremii</i>. Bladderworts are accompanied by mosses of the family <i>Amblystegiaceae </i>and <i>Sphagnum </i>spp. This vegetation requires permanent flooding. It is common in north-western and northern Europe, but rare in the Czech Republic.
XAA;;;This alliance includes vegetation of trampled habitats with dominance or frequent occurrence of <i>Polygonum arenastrum</i>, which is mostly found in lowlands and colline landscapes, on warm and dry sites. Some communities contain southern European species which are archaeophytes in central Europe, e.g. <i>Coronopus squamatus. Eragrostis minor </i>and <i>Sclerochloa dura</i>. This alliance is distributed across the temperate zone of Europe.
XAB;;;This alliance occurs in wetter and cooler areas than the alliance <i>Coronopodo-Polygonion arenastri</i>. In Europe it is more common in oceanic to suboceanic areas, while in the Czech Republic it is more frequent in colline to submontane areas than in the lowlands. In many cases soils are wetter, nutrient-poorer and more acidic than in the previous alliance, and these conditions support occurrence of more bryophytes and perennial vascular plants, although annual vascular plants predominate in this vegetation type.
XBA;;;The alliance<i> Caucalidion </i>includes vegetation of thermophilous annual weeds growing in cereal fields or vineyards on base-rich soils at low altitudes. Its distribution range includes central and southern Europe. <i>Caucalidion </i>communities are often rich in species and contain several endangered species, mostly archaeophytes of Mediterranean or Near East origin. In the past it contained some weed species which were sown with the crop every year, but with the advent of modern seed-cleaning technologies these species rapidly declined. Species composition of <i>Caucalidion </i>vegetation changes remarkably during the season, and therefore separate associations are recognized for spring and summer communities on the same sites.
XBB;;;This is annual weed vegetation developing in root-crop cultures on base-rich loamy or clayey soils in warm areas. Depending on the type of planted crop and agricultural management, it may temporally alternate with <i>Caucalidion </i>vegetation. Compared with the alliance <i>Caucalidion </i>this vegetation type contains more native species and neophytes but less archaeophytes.
XBC;;;The alliance <i>Scleranthion annui </i>includes weed vegetation of cool and precipitation-rich areas, developing usually on acidic soils. It can also occur on wet or nutrient-poor soils in warmer and drier lowlands. The distribution range of this vegetation includes western, central and eastern Europe. Most often it develops in winter crops and recent fallows, but it can also occur in root-crop fields. Generally, in cooler and wetter areas where this vegetation occurs the difference in weed species composition between cereal and root-crop fields is smaller than in warm and dry areas.
XBD;;;This alliance includes weed communities of cereal fields, developing on soils which are more acidic and nutrient-poorer than soils associated with any other alliance of the class <i>Stellarietea mediae</i>. It occurs both on sandy soils and wet podzols. The geographic range of this alliance includes north-western Europe; the Czech occurrences are on the south-eastern edge of its range and some diagnostic species occurring in this alliance in north-western Europe are absent here.
XBE;;;This alliance includes weed vegetation in cereal fields, root-crop cultures and kitchen gardens. It is widespread across most of Europe and is also found in continental Siberia. In the Czech Republic it occurs from the lowlands to the montane belt on nutrient-rich, neutral to slightly acidic soils which are wetter than those of the alliances <i>Veronico-Euphorbion </i>or <i>Scleranthion annui</i>.
XBF;;;This alliance includes weed vegetation with C4 grasses such as <i>Digitaria sanguinalis. Echinochloa crus-galli </i>and <i>Setaria </i>spp., occurring on dry soils in warm lowland areas. It is common in eastern Europe, while in central and western Europe it is increasingly restricted to sandy soils. It develops mainly in maize, root-crop or vegetable fields and in vineyards. Most species are warmth-demanding annuals that germinate late in the season and prefer cultures that are harvested in late summer or early autumn.
XBG;;;The alliance <i>Atriplicion </i>includes several associations of medium-tall to tall erect annual herbs (mainly from the <i>Brassicaceae. Chenopodiaceae </i>or <i>Asteraceae</i>), which occur in ruderal habitats. They occur on recently disturbed sites with exposed bare soils as initial stages of secondary succession, e.g. in construction areas or around farms. Soils are mostly mesic and available nutrients are moderate. Unlike in the alliance <i>Sisymbrion officinalis</i>, most of the dominant species are summer annuals that attain their maximum biomass from mid-summer to autumn. The alliance is widespread and common across central Europe and adjacent regions.
XBH;;;This alliance includes stands of medium-tall winter-annual grasses, e.g. <i>Bromus sterilis. B. tectorum </i>and <i>Hordeum murinum</i>; it includes some ancient, archaeophytic, ruderal vegetation types. These species rapidly colonize recently disturbed or exposed habitats around construction sites, in settlements, on roadsides, at the margins of shrubberies or on the tops of walls. The phenological optimum of this thermophilous and drought-adapted vegetation type is in spring.
XBI;;;This alliance includes low-growing vegetation dominated by prostrate archaeophytic annuals. It is confined to areas under traditional management such as trampled village yards, fowl runs and the edges of refuse dumps. The soils are rich in nutrients, especially due to dung water enrichment. This alliance is more common in the Balkans and eastern Europe. In the Czech Republic it is retreating due to socio-economic changes in village communities and decline of livestock or fowl-keeping in village households.
XBJ;;;<i>Salsolion ruthenicae </i>includes species-poor vegetation with annual species, among which are many neophytes. It forms initial successional stages on sunny sites with nutrient-poor, well drained sandy or gravelly soils, occasionally with elevated salt content. This vegetation type is most common in central Asian semi-deserts, which is the area of origin of several neophytes occurring on disturbed sandy sites in subcontinental areas of Europe.
XBK;;;The alliance <i>Eragrostion cilianensi-minoris </i>includes thermophilous vegetation occurring on sandy or gravelly soils and composed of low-growing species adapted to occasional trampling. In most stands the dominant species are annual grasses, many of them with a C4 metabolism. This vegetation attains maximum biomass in the dry and hot periods of mid-summer. The range of this alliance includes warm areas of central Europe and the Balkans.
XCA;;;The alliance <i>Onopordion acanthii </i>comprises thermophilous to moderately thermophilous anthropogenic vegetation with a predominance of biennial and perennial plants. Soils are usually dry and developed on loess or hard base-rich bedrock types, but also on anthropogenic substrates such as building rubble in villages, around castle ruins and in waste places. In the course of secondary succession in anthropogenic habitats this vegetation usually develops out of stands of the <i>Atriplicion. Sisymbrion officinalis </i>and <i>Malvion neglectae</i>. <i>Onopordion acanthii </i>is an ancient type of ruderal vegetation, which has probably been common since the Neolithic. It contains many archaeophytes, of which several are endangered species of the Czech flora; there are few neophytes.
XCB;;;This alliance includes ruderal vegetation with a predominance of biennial and perennial species, often forming the initial stages of succession on anthropogenic substrates. It occurs on shallow soils with a high content of gravel or dross, which are dry and poor in nutrients. This vegetation type includes several symbiotic nitrogen-fixers of <i>Fabaceae </i>in its composition. Most stands are rich in species. This vegetation type existed already in the Middle Ages, but it spread extensively during the 20th century due to the development of road and railway network, building construction and mining activities. It contains a high proportion of both archaeophytes and neophytes. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type is most common in warm areas, but some types can also occur in cooler areas at higher altitudes.
XCC;;;The alliance<i> Convolvulo-Elytrigion </i>includes semi-natural and ruderal vegetation types of dry habitats with a high incidence of perennial grasses, some of them with extensive root or rhizome systems. Natural habitats of this vegetation type are slopes with occasional landslides or solifluction, particularly on soft sediments such as loess, where it borders on dry grasslands of the class <i>Festuco-Brometea</i>. In agricultural landscapes <i>Convolvulo-Elytrigion </i>communities are confined to the strips of land between roads and field margins and other anthropogenic habitats. Soils are loamy to clayey, often with high calcium content. This alliance is distributed in dry and warm areas of central, southern and eastern Europe.
XCD;;;This alliance includes rare, natural, open vegetation occurring rarely in the Pannonian region on steep loess slopes, e.g. in the concave, sunken dirt roads and surroundings of wine cellars in rural, loess areas. It contains species considered as relicts of the Pleistocene cold loess steppes, e.g. <i>Agropyron pectinatum. Kochia prostrata </i>and <i>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides</i>. These species are poor competitors that can grow only in open vegetation; they retreated from most localities due to formation of dense steppe in the wetter climate of the Holocene. The geographical range of this alliance extends from its westernmost limit in southern Moravia and Lower Austria through steppe and forest-steppe areas of south-eastern Europe to southern Russia. From the syntaxonomical point of view this association is transitional between the classes <i>Artemisietea vulgaris </i>and <i>Festuco-Brometea</i>.
XCE;;;This alliance includes ruderal vegetation types dominated by tall perennial, nutrient-demanding dicots with C or CR strategy. It occurs in both villages and cities, particularly on dumping sites, building rubble, disturbed sites around water courses or bodies, roadsides and vegetated strips along walls and fences. Soils can be either slightly wet or dry, and correspondingly species composition includes mesophilous or xerophilous species; in the syntaxonomical classification system this vegetation type is transitional between the classes <i>Artemisietea vulgaris </i>and <i>Galio-Urticetea</i>.
XDA;;;This alliance includes natural vegetation types of annual and perennial, nutrient- and moisture-demanding herbaceous plants. The stands are dense, involving several herbaceous lianas and herbs producing large amounts of biomass. Natural habitats are fringes of floodplain forests and scrub or banks of rivers and oxbows. However, this vegetation also develops in secondary habitats such as abandoned meadows and forest clearings in the floodplains.
XDB;;;This alliance includes vegetation dominated by <i>Petasites </i>species in the narrow floodplains of small to medium-sized streams, mainly in submontane and montane areas. Soils are rich in nutrients and contain a significant sand and gravel component. Many stands represent natural treeless vegetation type maintained by flooding. However, <i>Petasites </i>stands also develop in secondary habitats such as on the banks of regulated rivers, in abandoned wet meadows or on roadsides.
XDC;;;The alliance <i>Impatienti-Stachyion </i>includes nutrient-demanding herbaceous vegetation occurring in partially shaded habitats on forest edges, canopy openings and clearings from the lowlands to the alpine timberline. The stands are dominated by tall herbs which also occur in the forest herb layer, but they form dense stands only on more sun-exposed sites. This vegetation type usually develops directly as a consequence of disturbance in forest stands, but it can also develop out of abandoned grasslands or stands of annual weeds. Soils are mesic to wet; unlike in the alliance <i>Geo urbani-Alliarion petiolatae</i> they do not dry out in summer. In contrast to vegetation of the class <i>Epilobietea angustifolii</i>, which is also typical of disturbed forest sites, stands of the <i>Impatienti-Stachyion </i>are rich in nutrient-demanding species and lack many acidophilous species.
XDD;;;The alliance <i>Geo-Alliarion</i> includes thermophilous and nutrient-demanding vegetation types dominated by annual to short-lived perennial herbs. It occurs both in semi-natural and anthropogenic, partially shaded habitats, e.g. in fringes of forests and scrub, canopy openings of urban forests, parks, cemeteries, unmanaged gardens, disturbed stream banks, rubble of old buildings and along walls and fences. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type occurs mainly in colline areas.
XDE;;;This alliance includes productive ruderal and semi-natural vegetation types of mesic and nutrient-rich habitats. Individual associations are represented by species-poor monodominant stands of various broad-leaved perennial herbs, especially of tall <i>Apiaceae</i>. Most of the dominants are native species which tend to spread in anthropogenic habitats, however, we assign to this alliance also monodominant stands of some invasive neophytes. Habitats include roadsides, unmanaged gardens, parks, abandoned meadows, waste places or disturbed stream banks. This alliance is widespread and common from lowland to montane areas of the Czech Republic.
XDF;;;<i>Rumicion alpini </i>includes vegetation of nutrient-demanding tall forbs in the montane to alpine belt. It originates through initial trampling and nutrient input, e.g. on mountain pastures, and subsequent abandonment. Soils are mesic to wet. Most stands are species-poor and monodominant. This vegetation type is native in high mountains of central Europe, but in the lower Hercynic ranges such as the Sudeten range of the Czech Republic it was introduced by settlers coming from the Alps in the 16th and 17th century.
XEA;;;This alliance represents initial stages of secondary succession on disturbed forest sites. It is herbaceous vegetation composed of both low and tall graminoids and dicots. Early successional stages are characterized by low-growing herbs, while in more advanced stages tall clonal herbs become common. It occurs mainly on nutrient-poor bedrock across the Czech Republic.
