AAA01;;;This alpine heathland includes low-growing, species-poor stands dominated by <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, accompanied by <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea,</i> graminoids and lichens. It is the natural vegetation of wind-swept ridges in the highest summit areas at altitudes above 1400 m in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains, and less frequently also in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains.
AAA02;;;This community of dwarf shrubs is dominated by <i>Empetrum hermaphroditum</i>. It is rarely found in small stands on the wind-swept summits of the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains, where it usually occurs on the edges of isolated rock outcrops or screes.
ABA01;;;These alpine grasslands, supported by siliceous bedrocks, are dominated by the tussock-forming grasses <i>Festuca supina</i> and <i>Avenella flexuosa</i>. They have a rich lichen component. The association occurs on wind-exposed ridges and slopes from the timberline at approximately 1250 m to the highest summits of the Czech mountains. The soils are regularly disturbed by freeze-thaw cycles and aeolian erosion. Most stands are found in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains, but several of them also occur in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains.
ABB01;;;These grasslands occur in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains, where they are mostly dominated by <i>Nardus stricta</i>, and in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains, where <i>Avenella flexuosa</i> is usually the dominant species. A typical feature of this species-poor, acidophilous vegetation is the occurrence of <i>Carex bigelowii</i> and <i>Festuca supina</i>. It is a natural grassland occurring above the timberline where it occupies large areas. In the past it probably spread due to grazing and mowing on the summit plateaus and on slopes around the timberline. Due to abandonment and increased atmospheric nutrient deposition the stands of <i>Nardus stricta</i> are currently declining to the benefit of taller, more nutrient-demanding grasses.
ACA01;;;This association includes grasslands dominated by <i>Festuca versicolor</i>, which contain several basiphilous alpine species. It occurs on outcrops of base-rich rocks in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains, namely in two glacial cirques on the Czech side (Velk&aacute; Koteln&iacute; j&aacute;ma, Ob&#345;&iacute; d&#367;l) and one cirque on the Polish side of the mountain range (Mal&aacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&aacute; j&aacute;ma).
ACA02;;;This alpine grassland dominated by <i>Agrostis alpina</i> contains several basiphilous species of the alpine belt and thermophilous species typical of lower altitudes. It is endemic to the steep slopes of the Velk&aacute; kotlina cirque in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains, where it occurs on base-rich rock oucrops.
ADA01;;;These are species-poor subalpine grasslands dominated by <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, containing some moisture-demanding species, such as those of the genus <i>Sphagnum</i>. In places a thin peat layer may accumulate. The stands of this community usually occur on upper leeward slopes in glacial cirques with a massive winter snow pack and abundant spring moisture during thaw. They occur in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains; rare and fragmentary stands have also been recorded in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains.
ADA02;;;This association includes natural subalpine vegetation dominated by the tall rhizomatous grass <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i>. Such grasslands are common around and above the timberline, but most of them are rather poor in species. Species-richer stands are mostly found on the upper slopes of glacial cirques, where pronounced snow cover accumulates in winter and protects plants against frost. This vegetation is mainly distributed in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains and rarely in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains.<b>
ADA03;;;This vegetation type is dominated by the tussock-forming grass <i>Deschampsia cespitosa</i> and contains some tall forbs and the grass <i>Poa chaixii</i>. It occurs in the subalpine belt of the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains on gentle slopes, plateaus or in shallow and flat depressions, where soil is well supplied with moisture, e.g., near springs or in places with deep snow pack. Some stands are natural, but others developed as a result of human activities. Species-poor stands of <i>Deschampsia cespitosa</i>, physiognomically similar to this association, are currently spreading in abandoned meadows and pastures of the Krkono&#353;e Mountains.
ADB01;;;This subalpine grassland, dominated by <i>Calamagrostis arundinacea</i>, occurs in the glacial cirques of the Krkono&#353;e and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains. It is confined to well-insolated steep slopes with pronounced winter snow accumulation which thaws rather early in spring and does not delay the advent of the growing season. The altitudes supporting this vegetation mainly correspond to the upper part of the forest belt, but in the habitats of <i>Calamagrostis arundinacea</i> trees are excluded by avalanche disturbance. The favourable temperature regime supports the occurrence of some herbs typical of deciduous forests, but species of the alpine belt are also present. This peculiar mixture of species of different origins fosters the exceptional species richness, which is higher than in other natural grassland communities of the subalpine or alpine belt in the Czech mountains.
ADC01;;;This association includes open-canopy subalpine shrubberies dominated by <i>Betula carpatica</i> or <i>Salix silesiaca</i>, with a number of species typical of the herbaceous vegetation of <i>Mulgedio-Aconitetea</i> occurring in the herb layer. These shrubberies are found on avalanche tracks in the glacial cirques of the Krkono&#353;e and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains, where they occupy marginal or terminal positions, only disturbed by less frequent, larger avalanches. Besides being disturbed by avalanches, woody plants in these places are affected by slow down-slope movement (creep) of the deeply packed snow.
ADC02;;;This is a rare subalpine shrub community dominated by <i>Prunus padus</i> subsp. <i>borealis</i> and <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> subsp. <i>glabrata</i>. In the Czech Republic, it is found on avalanche tracks in the glacial cirques of the western Krkono&#353;e Mountains. It occurs at wetter sites than the <i>Salici silesiacae-Betuletum carpaticae.</i>
ADD01;;;This association typifies tall and close-canopy stands dominated by <i>Adenostyles alliariae</i> which is accompanied by several species of subalpine tall forbs. The stands occur in wet places such as along streams, in depressions, and in places with large snow accumulation. This vegetation type is found both above and below the timberline in the Krkono&#353;e and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains. In some places it occupies large canopy openings in subalpine spruce forests.
ADD02;;;This association includes patchy stands of the shrubby willow <i>Salix lapponum</i> &ndash; a glacial relict of arctic origin in the Krkono&#353;e and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains. It occurs in wet places around springs, in depressions with heavy snow accumulation, and on the margins of mires in the subalpine belt.
ADD03;;;This rare association includes dense polydominant herbaceous vegetation occurring around springs on the upper slopes of the glacial cirques of the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains. It is a natural subalpine grassland developing in places of great snow accumulation, which might have been occasionally mown or grazed by domestic animals in the past.
ADD04;;;This grassland association is endemic to the glacial cirques of the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains. It occurs on avalanche tracks and sites with pronounced snow accumulation in the lower part of the cirques, on soils well supplied with water and nutrients. The stands are usually polydominant and consist of a rich mixture of grasses and tall forbs. Besides the <i>Bupleuro longifoliae-Calamagrostietum arundinaceae</i>, this is the species-richest community of natural grassland vegetation of the alpine and subalpine belts of the Czech mountains.
ADD05;;;<i>Chaerophyllo-Cicerbitetum</i> includes tall-forb stands dominated by <i>Cicerbita alpina</i> and <i>Petasites albus</i>, with frequent occurrence of forest species and subalpine tall forbs. It mainly occurs in shaded habitats of the montane belt, usually along streams on the bottoms of forested valleys. Some of these sites are naturally treeless, e.g. due to high snow accumulation or natural disturbances due to tree fall, however, this vegetation type may also be found in secondary habitats. It occurs in most of the mountain ranges along the border of the Czech Republic.
ADE01;;;This type of species-rich subalpine tall-fern vegetation is dominated by <i>Dryopteris filix-mas</i> and contains both species of subalpine tall-forb vegetation and species of beech and ravine forests. It occurs on steep and well-insolated, partly soil-filled talus slopes in the glacial cirques of the Krkono&#353;e, Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains. Winter snow cover is rather deep, ensuring frost protection for plants, however, it thaws quite early in spring due to slope steepness and direct exposure to the sun.
ADE02;;;These tall-fern stands are dominated by <i>Athyrium distentifolium</i> and contain several species of subalpine vegetation and those frequently found in the forest herb layer. The overall species richness is rather low. They occur in the subalpine belt of the Krkono&#353;e, Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k, Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k and &#353;umava Mountains, where they are mainly found on slopes of glacial cirques, and in canopy openings in fern-rich subalpine spruce forests. Sites are wet and well-protected by snow in winter.
KAA01;;;The association <i>Salicetum triandrae</i> is dominated by <i>Salix triandra</i> or <i>S. viminalis</i>. Frequently found but with a lower cover are also <i>S. euxina</i> and <i>S. purpurea</i>. Although <i>S. euxina</i> is potentially tree, it is often shrubby or low-growing in this vegetation due to frequent disturbances by the current. This vegetation occurs on loamy or sandy sediments along rivers from lowlands to the altitudes of about 450 m. The original composition of the herb layer has been strongly altered due to the spread of invasive neophytes.
KAB01;;;This willow-scrub association of gravelly river beds is characterized by <i>Salix elaeagnos</i>, in places also <i>S. daphnoides</i>. Most stands are co-dominated by <i>S. purpurea</i>. It occurs on gravel beds of streams in the Moravskoslezsk&eacute; Beskydy Mountains and their foothills in north-eastern Moravia. The best developed stands occur along the Mor&aacute;vka river, but this association can also be found along the Ostravice, &#268;eladenka, Kopytn&aacute; and other streams in that region.
KAB02;;;This type of riparian scrub is dominated by <i>Salix purpurea</i>, which is accompanied by other willow species, namely <i>S. euxina</i>, <i>S. triandra</i> and <i>S. viminalis</i>. It occurs rarely on gravelly and sandy accumulations of montane and submontane rivers, especially in the &#353;umava and Moravskoslezsk&eacute; Beskydy Mountains. This scrub develops on gravel bars in the floodplains after strong floods or on disturbed stream banks. During succession in the absence of strong disturbance it can be replaced by <i>Alnus incana</i> woodland.
KAB03;;;This alluvial scrub is composed of open to closed stands of <i>Myricaria germanica</i>, which may be accompanied by shrubby willows such as <i>Salix daphnoides</i>, <i>S. elaeagnos</i> and <i>S. purpurea.</i> The stands may be 1&ndash;2 m tall. They occur on gravelly river terraces, especially those that are not affected by the strongest current during floods. They are occasionally flooded, but for most of the year the water table lies several dozen centimetres belowground. In the Czech Republic this vegetation historically occurred along several streams in the Moravskoslezsk&eacute; Beskydy Mountains in north-eastern Moravia, but most localities disappeared after streamflow started to be regulated in the second half of the 20th century. The only site where this vegetation currently occurs in its natural habitat is in the Mor&aacute;vka river floodplain near the village of Dobr&aacute; in north-eastern Moravia; here the <i>Myricaria germanica</i> population went extinct in the 1990s and was restored by planting individuals of local origin. However, stands corresponding to this association also developed in limestone quarries near &#353;tramberk on the foothills of the Moravskoslezsk&eacute; Beskydy.
KAC01;;;This softwood floodplain forest type is dominated by <i>Salix alba</i>, rarely also by <i>Populus nigra.</i> It occurs along large lowland rivers at altitudes up to 335 m. The stands were historically affected by regular spring floods, which have become rare after streamflow started to be regulated in the first half of the 20th century.
KAC02;;;This softwood floodplain forest type is dominated by <i>Salix euxina</i> or <i>S. ×rubens</i>, while other willows (<i>S. purpurea</i>, <i>S. triandra</i> and <i>S. viminalis</i>) may occur in its shrub layer. It occurs on regularly or occasionally flooded sites along streams at altitudes of 150&ndash;750 m. Some occurrences have developed as secondary vegetation on former riparian alder forest sites or in abandoned wet meadows.
KBA01;;;This association is dominated by the low-growing clonal shrub <i>Prunus fruticosa</i>, often accompanied by other shrubs such as <i>P. spinosa</i>, <i>Rosa canina</i>, <i>R. gallica</i>, <i>R. marginata</i> and <i>R. spinosissima</i>. The stands are usually 50&ndash;150 cm tall. They occur in warm and dry areas, mainly over base-rich bedrock, where they may grow at the edges of tall scrub, as secondary successional communities after abandonment of management on dry grasslands or as primary vegetation on cliff ledges.
KBA02;;;This association is formed of clonal stands of about 1 m tall <i>Prunus tenella</i>, with an array of drought-adapted ruderal herb species. It is typical of the forest-steppe areas of east-central and eastern Europe, where it occurs in transitional zones between forest and open steppe or in terrain depressions with mesic soils in landscapes dominated by dry steppe. In the Czech Republic only three small stands occur in southern Moravia, all spatially close to steppe grasslands on loess but at the same time adjacent to man-made habitats such as arable land, vineyards, terraced slopes or dirt roads.
KBB01;;;This association is dominated by <i>Cotoneaster integerrimus</i>, and on a few sites in southern Moravia also by <i>C. laxiflorus.</i> Individuals of <i>Sorbus aria</i> agg. and other woody species can occur. The herb layer contains thermophilous rock-outcrop species. It is a natural vegetation type of rock outcrops, on which it forms small-scale stands, but it has also spread to deforested rocky slopes. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly on the volcanic hills of northern Bohemia and in deep river valleys in central Bohemia and south-western Moravia.
KBB02;;;This thermophilous scrub community is dominated by <i>Cornus mas</i> or <i>Prunus mahaleb</i>, which are accompanied by other species such as <i>Euonymus verrucosus</i>, <i>Viburnum lantana</i> and short individuals of oaks. The herb layer contains several species typical of thermophilous oak forests. This community occurs on calcareous bedrock types in dry areas of central Bohemia and southern Moravia, often in contact with dry grasslands and thermophilous oak forests.
KBB03;;;This shrub community is dominated by <i>Corylus avellana</i>, which is accompanied by other species of shrubs and short individuals of trees. The herb layer is rich in species of dry grasslands and base-rich deciduous forests, but it also contains species considered to be relicts of early Holocene open woodlands. It is mostly found in deep river valleys or on steep hillsides at altitudes of 300&ndash;800 m, mainly on limestone, but also on other types of parent material in different regions of the Czech Republic.
KBB04;;;<i>Pruno-Ligustretum</i> is an association of species-rich, dense thermophilous scrub dominated or co-dominated by <i>Cornus sanguinea</i>, <i>Corylus avellana</i>, <i>Crataegus monogyna</i> s. l., <i>Ligustrum vulgare</i>, <i>Prunus spinosa</i>, <i>Rosa canina</i> agg. and other species. Its herb layer contains a mixture of species of forests, dry and mesic grasslands, and some nutrient-demanding ruderal species. This association is common in lowlands and colline landscapes over a broad range of mesic and dry habitats, mainly developed as secondary scrub but in some places also as natural vegetation.
KBB05;;;This association comprises dense scrub of alluvial habitats dominated by <i>Cornus sanguinea</i>, <i>Crataegus laevigata</i>, <i>C. monogyna</i> s. l. and <i>Prunus spinosa</i>, with a frequent admixture of trees and shrubs typical of floodplain forests. It is characterized by the occurrence of herbaceous lianas and herbs of wet and nutrient-rich habitats. <i>Rhamno-Cornetum</i> develops as a secondary vegetation type replacing floodplain forests along lowland rivers, namely the Labe, Morava and Dyje. It occurs at forest edges, along river banks, roads and on abandoned meadows.
KBB06;;;<i>Carpino-Prunetum</i> is a widespread type of mesic scrub dominated by <i>Prunus spinosa</i> together with <i>Crataegus</i> spp., <i>Rosa canina</i> and <i>R. dumalis</i>. Other species of mesophilous shrubs and short individuals of trees are common. The herb layer is composed of species of mesic grasslands and forests and includes nitrophilous species and species of forest clearings. It occurs from warm colline landscapes, where it is confined to shaded and relatively cool habitats, to mid-altitudes, where it mostly grows on sunny slopes. It occurs over a broad range of bedrock and soil types. Nearly all stands are secondary shrub communities developed in potential forest habitats.
KBC01;;;This association includes small-scale shrubby stands of <i>Ribes alpinum</i> and/or <i>Rosa pendulina</i>, rarely also <i>R. majalis</i>, often with <i>Lonicera nigra</i> or <i>L. xylosteum</i>, the former at lower and the latter at higher altitudes. It occurs in colline to montane forested landscapes on steep rocky or talus slopes, where the development of forest canopy is prevented by the absence of continuous soil cover. It is also found as a stage of secondary succession after forest disturbance. It occurs over a broad range of acidic and calcareous bedrock types.
KBC02;;;This community is dominated by <i>Rubus idaeus</i>, but other <i>Rubus</i> species as well as <i>Betula pendula</i> or <i>Sambucus racemosa</i> are also frequent. It is common from the colline to the montane belt, occurring on soils of various nutrient status from oligotrophic to eutrophic. It is a secondary vegetation type of clearings and canopy openings of beech, fir and acidophilous oak forests.
KBC03;;;This community is dominated by <i>Sambucus racemosa</i>, which is frequently accompanied by other pioneer woody plants such as <i>Betula pendula</i> or <i>Salix caprea</i>. Herb layer contains species of forest herb layers and clearings. It occurs on clearings of beech, fir or spruce forests, at forest edges and in canopy openings at middle and higher altitudes, especially above 500 m. In many cases this is a successional stage following after <i>Rubetum idaei</i>.
KBC04;;;<i>Senecioni-Coryletum</i> is dominated by <i>Corylus avellana</i>, which is accompanied by fast-growing pioneer trees and shrubs such as <i>Populus tremula</i>, <i>Salix caprea</i> and <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>. The herb layer contains species of mesic forests and forest clearings, ranging from acidophytes to nitrophytes. This association occurs at altitudes of 300&ndash;700 m on poorly weathering bedrock types such as gneiss and granite. It occurs in habitats of disturbed forests, such as clearings, canopy openings and forest road edges, but it is also found in open agricultural landscapes. Most stands replace beech, fir, oak-hornbeam and acidophilous oak and ravine forests.
KBC05;;;This association is dominated by shrubs or trees of <i>Salix caprea</i>, accompanied by other pioneer woody plants, e.g. <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Populus tremula</i> and <i>Rubus</i> spp. Conifers such as <i>Picea abies</i> are also common. The herb layer includes light-demanding species of early successional phases of disturbed forest as well as ruderal and acidophilous species. <i>Salicetum capreae</i> occurs on forest clearings and different kinds of disturbed sites both in forested and open landscapes, as well as in urban or village habitats, where it often develops on building rubble. At lower altitudes the stands are short-lived and quickly replaced by other trees, while in the montane belt they may exist for several decades. In the Czech Republic most records are from mid-altitude areas.
KBC06;;;<i>Piceo-Sorbetum</i> is dominated by <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>, growing mostly as a shrub, which is accompanied by other woody plants tolerant to nutrient-poor soils, such as <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Rubus idaeus</i>. The herb layer consists of acidophilous grasses, dwarf shrubs and dicot herbs. This is a short-lived community occuring on clearings of acidophilous beech forests or spruce plantations in the submontane and montane belts, where it is being gradually replaced by successional stands of birch or spruce. In some places it is also found on rock outcrops and talus slopes or on successional sites in the open landscape.
KBD01;;;This scrub type is dominated by the mesophilous nutrient-demanding shrub <i>Sambucus nigra</i> and contains various ruderal, nutrient-demanding herbs<i>.</i> In the lowlands and colline areas it occurs both in human settlements and open landscapes, while at higher altitudes it is confined to the settlements. It is found along roads, on the edges of forests or arable fields, on building rubble and in other types of abandoned ruderal habitats.
KBD02;;;This community is dominated by <i>Lycium barbarum</i>, an alien shrub of Asian origin. Interior parts of the stands contain considerable amounts of dry <i>Lycium</i> branches. The herb layer is characterized by both perennial and annual ruderal species. It occurs on dry, sun-exposed sites in warm lowland and colline landscapes, e.g. on vineyard terraces, railway rights-of-way and road banks or along fences and walls. At higher altitudes it is confined to urban habitats. The soils are usually calcareous and well drained. Some stands were planted to prevent soil erosion.
KBD03;;;<i>Sambuco-Aceretum negundo</i> comprises scrub or short woodland dominated by the North American neophyte <i>Acer negundo</i>. Usually it forms an open canopy allowing coexistence of other shrub or tree species of various environmental affinities, ranging from species of dry habitats to those typical of floodplain forests. The herb layer includes species of ruderal and wet riparian habitats, including invasive neophytes. <i>Acer negundo</i> is a pioneer woody plant capable of rapidly spreading in disturbed areas. It occurs on mesic to wet, well insolated sites in warm areas, including urban and village habitats, spoil heaps and forest edges or abandoned grasslands in lowland river floodplains. In the Czech Republic <i>Acer negundo</i>-dominated vegetation is most common in the river floodplains of southern Moravia.
KBE01;;;<i>Chelidonio-Robinietum</i> is an association of mesic woodlands dominated by <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>. <i>Sambucus nigra</i> usually occurs in the shrub layer. The herb layer is dominated by tall nutrient-demanding species, as well as species of the herb layer of the original native forest types. This association occurs in habitats of former ravine forests, oak-hornbeam forests and mesic types of thermophilous oak forests, both in forested and agricultural landscapes as well as in human settlements. While many stands were planted for wood production or erosion protection, others established spontaneously, either generatively or vegetatively.
KBE02;;;<i>Poo-Robinietum</i> is an association of open and mesic <i>Robinia</i> woodlands with the herb layer dominated by grasses, particularly <i>Poa nemoralis.</i> Nutrient-demanding dicot herbs are less common than in the <i>Chelidonio majoris-Robinietum pseudoacaciae</i>. It is usually found on slowly weathering siliceous bedrocks on upper and middle slopes in deep river valleys of the Bohemian Massif. Localities in the Czech Republic are concentrated in the river valleys of central and southern Bohemia and south-western Moravia.
KBF01;;;<i>Arrhenathero-Robinietum</i> includes tall forests of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> with straight trunks, which can grow as high as 30 m. The herb layer is dominated by the grasses <i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i>, <i>Calamagrostis epigejos</i>, <i>Festuca ovina</i> and <i>Poa nemoralis</i>, but other species can also occur and even dominate in places. Nutrient-demanding dicot herbs are rare. This association occurs in warm and dry lowland areas, mainly on sandy or gravelly terraces along large rivers such as the Labe in central and eastern Bohemia and the Morava and Dyje in southern Moravia.
KBG01;;;This association includes short, often shrubby stands of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>, usually up to 5 m tall. Drought-adapted shrubs such as <i>Crataegus</i> spp., <i>Prunus spinosa</i> and <i>Rosa</i> spp. are common. The herb layer is often species-rich and composed of species of dry grasslands and thermophilous oak forests. <i>Melico-Robinietum</i> occurs on south-facing slopes with outcrops of both acidic and calcareous rocks. Most of these stands originated through expansion of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> from planted stands on deeper soils to adjacent dry grasslands. Most sites are found in deep valleys of Bohemian rivers and on volcanic hills in the &#268;esk&eacute; st&#345;edoho&#345;&iacute;.
KCA01;;;This association includes 0.5&ndash;2 m tall scrub of <i>Pinus mugo</i>, which locally covers extensive areas on nutrient-poor acidic soils in the subalpine belt of the Krkono&#353;e Mountains. The canopy can be open or closed. Near the alpine timberline, it may contain stunted individuals of <i>Picea abies</i> or <i>Sorbus aucuparia.</i> The herb layer is species-poor with acidophilous grasses such as <i>Avenella flexuosa</i>, <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i> and <i>Nardus stricta</i>, dwarf shrubs such as <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i> and acidophilous dicot herbs. In the Krkono&#353;e Mountains the altitudinal belt in which this vegetation type is continuous ranges from 1230 to 1500 m a. s. l., but small patches can occur on avalanche tracks as low as 1050 m. In the Czech part of the &#353;umava Mountains this association occurs as azonal vegetation, forming small patches on talus slopes at altitudes of 1080&ndash;1360 m. Plantations of non-native <i>Pinus mugo</i> in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains are floristically and physiognomically similar to the natural stands of this association.
KCA02;;;<i>Adenostylo-Pinetum mugo</i> is a rare community of <i>Pinus mugo</i> scrub with subalpine tall forbs such as <i>Athyrium distentifolium</i>, <i>Cicerbita alpina</i>, <i>Gentiana asclepiadea</i>, <i>Rumex arifolius</i>, <i>Senecio hercynicus</i> and <i>Veratrumalbum</i> subsp. <i>lobelianum</i>. It is found on avalanche tracks and on leeward slopes of glacial cirques in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains at altitudes of 1100&ndash;1300 m. These sites are characterized by a deep snowpack in winter, moist soil in spring and summer, and fast litter decomposition, which prevents accumulation of the thick raw humus typical of the previous association of <i>Pinus mugo</i> scrub. Only small patches of this vegetation are known from the Krkono&#353;e.
LAA01;;;This association of <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> carr occurs in acidic and nutrient-poor waterlogged habitats, which support occurrence of <i>Betula pubescens</i> and <i>Picea abies</i>. The herb layer is composed of acidophilous sedges and other species of nutrient-poor soils. The moss layer is well developed, with a significant participation of <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. In the Czech Republic this association occurs mainly in the Doksy region of northern Bohemia, but it has also been recorded in other areas of the Bohemian Massif.
LAA02;;;This swamp forest is dominated by <i>Alnus glutinosa</i>, with <i>Frangula alnus</i> and <i>Salix cinerea</i> participating in a sparse shrub layer. The herb layer is characterized by a distinct pattern of hummocks and hollows, the former being usually covered by tussocks of <i>Carex elongata</i>, accompanied by mesophytic species, the latter supporting marsh species and in places even some aquatic plants. This association develops in mesotrophic to eutrophic habitats with significant accumulation of undecomposed organic matter. In spring the water table usually rises above the ground level. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly on waterlogged sites near fishponds and in terrestrializing oxbows at lower and middle altitudes.
LAA03;;;This association of <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> swamp forest is usually characterized by the dominance in the herb layer of <i>Carex acutiformis</i> or <i>Scirpus sylvaticus</i>. It occurs in waterlogged sites, but the water table does not rise above the ground level as often as in the previous two associations of alder carrs. Also the organic sediment is shallower and the ground surface is not so distinctly differentiated into hummocks and hollows as in <i>Carici elongatae-Alnetum glutinosae</i>. In the Czech Republic this association occurs in the Bohemian Massif.
LAB01;;;<i>Salicetum auritae</i> is an oligotrophic to mesotrophic type of willow carr, dominated by <i>Salix aurita</i>, <i>S. cinerea</i>, <i>Frangula alnus</i>, and on some sites in southern Bohemia also by <i>Spiraea salicifolia</i>. The herb layer includes species typical of acidic fens and moss layer is often dominated by species of <i>Sphagnum</i>. This vegetation occurs in fen complexes, near nutrient-poor ponds and on abandoned acidic wet meadows. Its distribution in the Czech Republic is poorly known.
LAB02;;;This association includes eutrophic willow carrs, most frequently dominated by <i>Salix cinerea</i> and in some places also by <i>S. aurita</i>. The herb layer is composed of nutrient-demanding wetland plants, whereas oligotrophic herbs typical of the previous association are rare. Soils are either organic or gleysols. The water table is near the ground surface for most of the year, and periodically the sites are flooded. This association is common on waterlogged sites throughout the Czech Republic, but is poorly documented by relev&eacute;s.
LBA01;;;This association includes montane floodplain forests dominated by <i>Alnus incana</i>, in places with an admixture of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Picea abies</i>. The herb layer is species-rich and includes several species of tall forbs. Soils contain a large proportion of sand, gravel and stones. Floods are more frequent than in other types of floodplain forests but they are of shorter duration. In the Czech Republic this association occurs in higher mountain areas across the country.
LBA02;;;This woodland is dominated by <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> or <i>A. incana</i>, while <i>Picea abies</i> is a constant accompanying species in the canopy. Its herb layer contains species of acidic soils, cool areas and springs. This association occurs along slowly running streams in submontane to montane areas. Peat forms on the soil surface. Many of the current stands originated through forest succession on abandoned, nutrient-poor wet meadows.
LBA03;;;This forest is dominated by <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> or <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>. Its herb layer contains <i>Cardamine amara</i>, <i>Carex remota</i> and other species of springs and wet sites in forests. Most species in its herb layer are nutrient-demanding, while acidophilous species are largely absent. This community occurs in forested springs on slopes or on waterlogged sites along slowly moving brooks on valley bottoms. This vegetation is widespread across the Czech Republic, especially at mid-altitudes, but most of the stands are spatially restricted.
LBA04;;;<i>Stellario-Alnetum</i> is an association dominated by <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> or <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>. Its herb layer contains hygrophilous species, but unlike in other types of <i>Alnus-Fraxinus</i> floodplain forests mesophilous species are well represented. It occurs in narrow floodplains along small to medium-sized streams from the colline to montane belt. Soils are sandy or stony. The water table can be as deep as 1 m below the surface. In many places this community has developed on abandoned wet meadows. It is widespread in the Czech Republic, being most common in deep river valleys of the Bohemian Massif and other areas with complex topography.
LBA05;;;<i>Pruno-Fraxinetum</i> comprises floodplain forests dominated by <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> or <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, with a well-developed shrub layer of <i>Prunus padus</i> subsp. <i>padus</i> and other species. Herb layer comprises nutrient-demanding species of shaded wet habitats or wet meadows. Species of mesic forests are rare. This association occurs in broad floodplains from the lowlands to altitudes of about 500 m. Many of the current stands originated through forest succession from abandoned wet meadows.
LBA06;;;<i>Ficario-Ulmetum</i> is a floodplain forest usually dominated by <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> or <i>Quercus robur</i>, with frequent participation of <i>Acer campestre</i>, <i>Ulmus laevis</i> and <i>U. minor</i> in the subcanopy. The herb layer is characterized by a distinctive synusia of vernal geophytes, which is replaced by tall nutrient-demanding dicot herbs and grasses in late spring and summer. This association is typical of lowland river floodplains that used to be flooded for several days or weeks in March&ndash;April. These floods intensified after medieval deforestation of submontane&ndash;montane areas and supplied this habitat with nutrients and significantly increased its productivity. After the onset of regulated river flows floods became rare and their extent limited. For most of the year the water table is deeper than 1 m below ground.
LBA07;;;This floodplain forest is dominated by <i>Fraxinus angustifolia</i> or <i>Quercus robur</i>, with frequent occurrence of <i>Acer campestre</i>, <i>Carpinus betulus</i>, <i>Ulmus laevis</i> and <i>U. minor</i> in the subcanopy and <i>Crataegus laevigata</i> in the shrub layer. The herb layer has a distinctive synusia of vernal geophytes and in summer is dominated by nutrient-demanding hygrophilous forest species, with participation of some species of wetlands and mesic forests. It occurs in broad floodplains of lowland rivers in southern Moravia, within the geographical range of <i>Fraxinus angustifolia</i>. These sites are wetter than those of the association <i>Ficario vernae-Ulmetum campestris</i>: before rivers were dammed they were flooded every year for several days to several weeks. Many stands originated from former woodland pastures, which were conducive to oak regeneration; in the current closed-canopy forests oak is being continuously replaced by ash. Also, trees of mesic sites are spreading due to bank stabilisation associated with streamflow regulation on major rivers.
LBB01;;;This association comprises forests of <i>Carpinus betulus</i>, <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. and locally also <i>Q. robur</i>. In some areas of southern and western Bohemia, <i>C. betulus</i> is absent due to migration constraints and the canopy is dominated by <i>Q. robur</i> and <i>Tilia cordata.</i> The herb layer has a constant representation of nemoral species, varying depending on soil properties. This association occurs across a broad range of soil conditions from acidic to calcareous, and mesic to moderately dry. This association is distributed in the western part of central Europe. In the Czech Republic, its occurrences are concentrated in the Bohemian Massif.
LBB02;;;These forests are dominated by <i>Carpinus betulus</i> and <i>Quercus robur</i>, less frequently also <i>Q. petraea</i> agg. Their herb layer contains species of mesic and wet soils, including nutrient-demanding species of disturbed habitats. <i>Stellario-Carpinetum</i> occurs on wetter soils than the other associations of the alliance <i>Carpinion betuli</i>. They can be either heavy soils with impeded drainage, or light soils on sites with a high water table.
LBB03;;;These forests are dominated by <i>Carpinus betulus</i> and <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. Their herb layer is often dominated by <i>Carex pilosa</i> and contains some species of subcontinental and Submediterranean distribution. The association is common at lower altitudes in the Carpathian part of the Czech Republic, with outlier occurrences also in the eastern part of the Bohemian Massif. Most stands are found on deep soils over flysch, but the range of soil conditions is broad.
LBB04;;;This association comprises forests dominated by <i>Carpinus betulus</i> and <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg., frequently accompanied by <i>Tilia cordata</i>. Their herb layer is composed of mesophilous (nemoral) species growing together with drought-adapted and light-demanding species of thermophilous oak forests and forest edges. Vernal synusiae with geophytes are well developed. Soils are usually calcareous and developed on flysch sediments or limestone. This association occurs in warm, dry areas of central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
LBC01;;;The association <i>Galio-Fagetum</i> includes mesic forests dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, which occur on cambisols over various types of bedrock. Their herb layer includes particularly forest generalists, but also some nutrient-demanding species of wet soils, as well as acidophytes, depending on local soil conditions. They are common across the Czech Republic in submontane and montane areas.
LBC02;;;<i>Mercuriali-Fraxinetum</i> comprises mesic nutrient-rich forests dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, locally mixed with the nutrient-demanding broad-leaved trees <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> or the conifers <i>Abies alba</i> and <i>Picea abies</i>. The herb layer consists of forest generalists and nitrophilous species, whereas acidophytes are rarer than in other forests of the alliance <i>Fagion sylvaticae</i>. This association occurs on different bedrock types, but it is found especially on lower slopes where nutrients accumulate. It is common in the submontane and montane areas of the Czech Republic.
LBC03;;;This is a forest type dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, in places mixed with <i>Carpinus betulus</i>, <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. and other species. Its herb layer is dominated by <i>Carex pilosa</i> and contains other species of eastern or southern distribution, in addition to mesic forest species shared with other types of beech forests. In the Czech Republic this association is confined to the Carpathians and the eastern edge of the Bohemian Massif, where it occurs, on average, at lower altitudes and warmer sites of the colline to montane belt than other beech forest types. Soils are cambisols developed on flysch sediments and other parent material.
LBC04;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> and <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i>, which often have twisted trunks caused by heavy snow cover or avalanches. The shrub layer is usually well developed with <i>Betula carpatica</i>, <i>Salix silesiaca</i> and <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>. The herb layer is dominated by montane to subalpine tall forbs such as <i>Adenostyles alliariae</i>, <i>Athyrium distentifolium</i>, <i>Cicerbita alpina</i> and <i>Veratrum album</i> subsp. <i>lobelianum</i>, and it also includes other moisture- and nutrient-demanding species. In the Czech Republic this association occurs mainly in deep valleys and glacial cirques at altitudes of 900&ndash;1200 m, which are characterized by abundant moisture, good nutrient supply and thick snow cover.
LBC05;;;These are coniferous forests dominated by <i>Abies alba</i> with frequent occurrence of <i>Picea abies</i>. The herb layer is composed of generalist species of mesotrophic forest soils, nutrient-demanding species and acidophytes. This vegetation type is associated with cambisols developed over gneiss, granite, flysch sediments and other soil and bedrock types. These forests developed from natural fir-beech forests under the impact of forest grazing, litter raking and selective logging. Beech is currently spreading and replacing fir in some parts of the range of this association. In the Czech Republic these forests are most common in south-western Bohemia and north-eastern Moravia, but also occur elsewhere at mid-altitudes.
LBD01;;;<i>Cephalanthero-Fagetum</i> is an association of calcicolous forests of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> with an admixture of other trees and often with a well-developed shrub layer composed of light-demanding species such as <i>Sorbus aria</i> agg. The herb layer contains mesophilous forest species together with calcicolous, thermophilous and light-demanding species, many of them typical of oak forests and forest edges. A typical feature of these forests is the occurrence of <i>Cephalanthera</i> spp. and other orchids. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type occurs on limestone, marlstone and calcareous sandstone at altitudes below 625 m. As such substrates are spottily distributed throughout the country, this vegetation type is not very common.
LBE01;;;This association comprises submontane acidophilous beech forests. They are dominated by <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, locally with <i>Picea abies</i> or other tree species. <i>Abies alba</i> used to be more common in the past but recently has become rare. The shrub and herb layers are sparse and species-poor. This association is common on acidic soils from lowlands to the montane belt, especially at altitudes of 400&ndash;700 m.
LBE02;;;This association comprises montane acidophilous beech forests. In addition to the dominant <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i> is frequent in the tree layer. The shrub layer is poorly developed and usually composed of tree regeneration. The herb layer is typically dominated by <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i>, locally also <i>C. arundinacea</i>, and it contains various montane species. This association occurs on nutrient-poor acidic soils at altitudes of 800&ndash;1150 m.
LBE03;;;<i>Luzulo-Abietetum</i> is an association of <i>Abies alba</i> forests with admixed <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and to a limited extent also with deciduous trees. Their shrub layer is poorly developed, while the species-poor herb layer is dominated by graminoids and in some places <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> or ferns. It occurs on nutrient-poor acidic rocks, on both gentle and steep slopes. Many stands probably developed from natural beech forests under long-term human impact.
LBE04;;;These species-poor forests are dominated by <i>Abies alba</i>, frequently mixed with <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>; these species also dominate the shrub layer. The herb layer is formed of acidophilous graminoids, ferns and <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>. A moss layer is well developed. This association occurs on different types of nutrient-poor siliceous bedrock, mainly on plateaus and gentle slopes from the colline to submontane belt. On most sites these fir stands developed from natural beech forests under long-term human impact.
LBF01;;;This association includes ravine and rock outcrop forests with a diverse tree layer containing <i>Acer</i> spp., <i>Carpinus betulus</i>, <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, <i>Quercus</i> spp., <i>Tilia</i> spp., <i>Ulmus glabra</i> and other species. The shrub layer is well developed and species-rich. The herb layer contains nitrophilous forest species and species of oak-hornbeam forests. This association is common especially at lower altitudes, mainly in the stream valleys of the Bohemian Massif.
LBF02;;;<i>Mercuriali-Fraxinetum</i> is a ravine or scree forest dominated mostly by <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i>, <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> and <i>Ulmus glabra</i>. The shrub and herb layers are usually well developed and contain nutrient- and moisture-demanding species. In contrast, thermophilous species typical of ravine forests at lower altitudes are absent. This association occurs at mid-altitudes throughout the Czech Republic.
LBF03;;;<i>Arunco-Aceretum</i> comprises forests of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> with a herb layer containing the tall forbs <i>Aruncus dioicus</i> and <i>Lunaria rediviva</i> and various nutrient- and moisture-demanding forest herbs. These forests occur especially on the lower part of steep slopes, especially in shaded ravines. This association occurs across a broad range of altitudes, with most occurrences between 300 and 900 m.
LBF04;;;<i>Seslerio-Tilietum</i> is a rock-outcrop forest association dominated by <i>Tilia cordata</i> or <i>T. platyphyllos</i>. Its tree layer is usually low and open, while the shrub layer is well developed, usually with <i>Corylus avellana</i>. The species-rich herb layer of this forest type is dominated by <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> and contains species of oak-hornbeam forests, thermophilous oak forests and various relict species of open habitats. This association typically occurs in small patches on upper parts of steep rocky slopes on limestone and other base-rich rocks. It is a thermophilous community occurring at altitudes between 250 and 500 m.
LCA01;;;This association includes open, low-growing woodlands dominated by <i>Quercus pubescens</i> agg. or <i>Q. petraea</i> agg. in central and northern Bohemia. In contrast to the next association, some easterly distributed species are missing and mesic forest species are more common. These forests occur on south-facing slopes over limestone in the Bohemian Karst and on basalt hills in the &#268;esk&eacute; st&#345;edoho&#345;&iacute;, rarely also on calcareous Cretaceous sediments and base-rich metamorphic rocks in the hilly landscapes along the Labe river.
LCA02;;;This association comprises open, low-growing stands of <i>Quercus pubescens</i> agg., in places accompanied by <i>Q. petraea</i> agg. Stand physiognomy is similar to that of the previous association, however, <i>Lithospermo-Quercetum pubescentis</i> contains a higher proportion of dry grassland species and several species absent in the dry areas of Bohemia, e.g. <i>Dorycnium herbaceum</i>, <i>Euonymus verrucosus</i>, <i>Euphorbia epithymoides</i>, <i>Inula ensifolia</i>, <i>Iris pumila</i> and <i>Verbascum chaixii</i> subsp. <i>austriacum</i>. It occurs in small patches on south-facing slopes with shallow, base-rich soils over calcareous flysch sediments or poorly weathering limestone in the dry areas of southern Moravia.
LCA03;;;This thermophilous oak forest of sunny slopes on base-rich soils is a transitional type between the dry and open thermophilous oak forests, represented by the two previous associations, and mesic oak-hornbeam forests. It is dominated by <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. or <i>Q. pubescens</i> agg., which are accompanied by mesophilous tree species. The shrub and herb layers are composed of a mixture of oak-forest and forest-fringe species with mesophilous forest species. In the driest areas, <i>Euphorbio-Quercetum</i> usually occurs as a transitional zone between <i>Quercus pubescens</i> agg. forests on south-facing slopes and oak-hornbeam forests on north-facing slopes or valley bottoms. Towards the margins of the dry regions, however, it is often confined to the regionally most xeric habitats, specifically the upper parts of south-facing slopes. It occurs in northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
LCB01;;;This association includes forests of <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg., <i>Q. pubescens</i> agg. and in places also <i>Acer campestre</i>, <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, <i>Q. robur</i>, and other mesophilous species. The shrub and herb layers are usually well developed and species-rich. These forests occur mostly in warm and dry hilly landscapes in the Western Carpathian foothills. They are confined to deep soils developed on calcareous flysch or less often Neogene sediments, often covered by loess. These soils are characterized by clay migration within the soil profile. In the Czech Republic this Pannonian association occurs only in southern Moravia.
LCB02;;;This association includes former forest pastures dominated by tall stands of <i>Quercus robur</i>. Their shrub layer is sparse, whereas the herb layer is well developed and species-rich. It contains several species adapted to an intermittent moisture regime. This association is endemic to lowland sandy plains of southern Moravia (Hodon&iacute;n region) and adjacent western Slovakia. The sand in this area is acidic, but overlays base-rich clays, which enables the occurrence of calcicoles mixed with acidophytes.
LCC01;;;This association is usually dominated by <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. The shrub layer is sparse and the herb layer is composed of acidotolerant, light-demanding thermophilous species, in some stands also with an admixture of species of mesic forests. A moss layer is often well developed. This vegetation occurs on south-facing slopes of poorly-weathering acidic rocks such as granite, gneiss, shale or volcanic rocks. Soils are usually shallow rankers or cambisols. In the Czech Republic this vegetation occurs mainly on volcanic hills of northern Bohemia and in deep river valleys of central and southern Bohemia and western Moravia.
LCC02;;;This association is similar to the previous one, but occurs on drier slopes, where the growth of oaks is stunted and the canopy very open. It is dominated by <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. The shrub layer is sparse, mostly consisting of low-growing individuals of the dominant species. The herb layer is characterized by the constant occurrence of the dwarf shrub <i>Genista pilosa</i> and the graminoids <i>Carex humilis</i> and <i>Festuca ovina</i>, accompanied by drought-adapted acidophilous species. A moss layer is well developed with <i>Ceratodon purpureus</i>, <i>Polytrichum piliferum</i> and several species of lichen genera <i>Cladonia</i> and <i>Xanthoparmelia.</i> It occurs on south-facing outcrops of poorly weathering acidic rocks such as granite, gneiss and granulite in the river valleys of south-western Moravia.
LCC03;;;This association includes open, currently usually tall-growing forests of <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. and/or <i>Q. robur.</i> In most places the shrub layer is poorly developed, while the herb layer is species-rich, consisting of species adapted to an intermittent moisture regime (many of them shared with the <i>Molinion caeruleae</i> meadows), species of thermophilous and acidophilous oak forests and oak-hornbeam forests. It occurs mainly on gentle slopes or flatland with heavy, clayey soils with a broad pH range, which are wet in spring but dry in periods of low or infrequent rainfall in summer. In the Czech Republic this association is distributed mainly on Cretaceous sediments of northern and eastern Bohemia, but also on colluvial loamy sediments and loess accumulations in the Bohemian Karst, southern Moravia and some other areas.
LDA01;;;This association includes mesic acidophilous oak forests dominated by <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg., less frequently <i>Q. robur</i>, with frequent admixture of <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> or <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>. The shrub layer is usually sparse. The herb layer is species-poor and usually dominated by the graminoids <i>Avenella flexuosa</i> or <i>Luzula luzuloides</i>. A moss layer is often well developed. This association occurs on nutrient-poor acidic soils on both flatland and slopes. Especially on flatland and gentle slopes it often evolved under long-term forest management that involved nutrient depletion. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in areas with poorly-weathering acidic rocks of the Bohemian Massif, especially in central Bohemia and south-western Moravia, but also in other areas.
LDA02;;;This association includes low-growing, open stands of <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg., with a sparse shrub layer or without a shrub layer altogether. The herb layer is usually dominated by the grasses <i>Avenella flexuosa</i> or <i>Festuca ovina</i>; it contains generalist acidophilous species but also some slightly thermophilous species. This is the association of acidophilous oak forests. It occurs on sunny slopes and around outcrops of poorly weathering acidic rocks in habitats that are usually slightly cooler or wetter than those of the association <i>Sorbo torminalis-Quercetum.</i>
LDA03;;;This association is dominated by <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg., less frequently by <i>Q. robur</i>, with a constant admixture of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. Its shrub layer is sparse and its herb layer is dominated by <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and other dwarf shrubs such as <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and <i>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</i>. It occurs on both shallow and deep, very nutrient-poor, often sandy soils developed over acidic bedrock. Some stands of this association developed as a result of historical forest use. In the Czech Republic these forests occur mainly in Bohemia.
LDA04;;;This association comprises acidophilous oak forests of wet habitats, dominated by <i>Quercus robur</i>, less frequently by <i>Q. petraea</i> agg., and accompanied by <i>Betula pendula</i> and <i>B. pubescens</i>. The shrub layer contains <i>Frangula alnus</i> in most stands, but it rarely reaches high cover. The herb layer is usually dominated by <i>Molinia arundinacea</i>, less frequently by <i>M. caerulea</i> or <i>Carex brizoides.</i> It contains generalist acidophilous species, but also some species of wet meadows. These forests occur in flatlands or shallow depressions with deep, nutrient-poor soils that tend to be wet from autumn to spring but dry out in summer.
LEA01;;;These forests are dominated by <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, in places with <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. in the understorey. They occur on serpentine slopes in two areas in the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands, namely the middle Jihlava valley and the &#382;elivka valley. They are situated at lower altitudes and in drier regions than most other serpentine areas in the Bohemian Massif. The herb layer of these pine forests contains several species typical of dry grasslands and several isolated occurrences of presumably relictual montane species. The serpentine specialists <i>Armeria elongata</i> subsp. <i>serpentini</i> and <i>Asplenium cuneifolium</i> are common. In places, the relictual dealpine grass <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> dominates the herb layer.
LFA01;;;<i>Festuco-Pinetum</i> is an association of open forest dominated by <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and characterized by the common occurrence of boreo-continental, peri-alpine and drought-adapted continental species, including species of dry grasslands. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly on marl or calcareous sandstone in northern Bohemia, but it can also rarely be found on other types of calcareous bedrock. Similar, basiphilous, species-rich pine forests occur on scattered sites in other regions of the Bohemian Massif. Some of the current pine forest stands may have developed from deciduous forests due to grazing and other human influences, while others may be natural vegetation maintained by recurrent wildfires.
LFB01;;;This association includes open, often short-growing stands of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, at most sites without any shrub layer. The herb layer is very poor in species, containing the dwarf shrubs <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>. The moss layer by contrast is well developed with lichens of the genus <i>Cladonia</i> and <i>Cetraria islandica</i>, as well as several moss species. This association occurs on very nutrient-poor soils over sand, sandstone or weathered granite. Some stands are stable in the long term, but many have developed from other forest types as a result of nutrient depletion caused by grazing, litter raking, and also through the preference of pine in managed forests.
LFB02;;;These forests dominated by <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> contain a species-poor herb layer consisting of acidophilous dwarf shrubs and herbs. A moss layer is well developed with the predominance of acidophilous mosses and admixture of terricolous lichens. They occur on rock outcrops in river valleys and sandstone areas, on stabilized sand dunes, sandy products of rock weathering, talus slopes and on serpentine. Pine forests in the most stressed habitats may have remained stable and occurred continuously throughout the Holocene, but others have probably developed as a result of historical forest managament. In the Czech Republic their occurrence is concentrated in the Bohemian Massif. In some sandstone areas they have recently been invaded by the North American eastern white pine, <i>Pinus strobus</i>.
LFB03;;;These small-scale forest stands are dominated by <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, frequently mixed with <i>Quercus petraea</i> agg. The herb layer is sparse and dominated by short acidophilous grasses and herbaceous plants typical of siliceous rock outcrops, whereas ericoid dwarf shrubs are rare. The moss layer is well developed, containing xerophilous species of mosses and lichens. This association is typical of sun-exposed rock outcrops, mainly in the deep river valleys of the Bohemian Massif. Most stands are probably primary relict pine forests, but some may have originated through human impact on dry oak forests.
LFB04;;;These are managed, usually even-aged forests of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> on serpentine bedrock, with a herb layer dominated by ericoid dwarf shrubs and grasses. Unlike the serpentine pine forests assigned to <i>Vaccinio myrtilli-Pinetum sylvestris</i>, this community is characterized by the frequent occurrence of <i>Silene vulgaris</i>, which locally prefers serpentine soils. Also characteristic is the serpentine specialist <i>Asplenium cuneifolium</i> as well as herbs indicating past forest grazing, some of them slightly thermophilous. Especially at higher altitudes the soil surface is covered by a distinct layer of poorly decomposed pine needle litter, which acidifies soils on base-rich serpentine substrate. The occurrence of pine on serpentine soils is probably natural, but forest structure has been modified by forest management. These forests are best developed in serpentine areas of western and southern Bohemia, but also occur in other serpentine areas of the Bohemian Massif, except on the driest and wettest sites.
LFC01;;;This is the most common type of spruce forest in the Czech mountains. It is dominated by <i>Picea abies</i>, with <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> as a subcanopy tree. Its species-poor herb layer is dominated by the grasses <i>Avenella flexuosa</i> and <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i> and the dwarf shrub <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>. The moss layer is well developed. In the Sudetes these spruce forests occur as zonal vegetation from about 1050 m a.s.l. up to the timberline, in the &#353;umava Mountains from about 1200 m. However, at sites with cool topoclimate these forests can occur at much lower altitudes, rarely even as low as 300 m. This community occurs mainly on acidic podzols, but also on gleyic soils or on rankers over talus slopes. Under natural conditions it was probably maintained by infrequent strong disturbances, especially large-scale windthrow events with subsequent insect outbreaks. Most of the current stands are managed.
LFC02;;;This association of spruce forest is characterized by a high cover of the fern <i>Athyrium distentifolium</i> and subalpine tall forbs. It occurs most often at altitudes of 1150&ndash;1250 m in places with accumulation of thick snow cover which is persistent until late spring. The snow cover protects vegetation from winter frosts, delays the start of the growing season and improves soil water supply. Such habitats are characterized by a better litter decomposition and faster nutrient cycling than in other spruce forests. It is a natural vegetation type forming small patches enclosed in the matrix of the <i>Calamagrostio villosae-Piceetum abietis</i> forests. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in the Sudetes and Moravskoslezsk&eacute; Beskydy Mountains, but scattered sites are also found in other mountain ranges over 1000 m.
LFC03;;;This is a forest dominated by <i>Picea abies</i>, locally accompanied by <i>Abies alba</i>, with a herb layer composed of species typical of spruce forests on mesic soils such as acidophilous grasses and <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>, and species typical of wet nutrient-rich soils. The moss layer is well developed, containing many hygrophilous species including those of the genus <i>Sphagnum</i>. It occurs on flat bottoms of broad valleys and basins with wet acidic soils and temperature inversions caused by cold air pooling. In most cases these forests grow in small patches surrounded by beech or mixed beech-conifer forests. On average they occur at lower altitudes than the previous two associations of spruce forests.
LFC04;;;<i>Soldanello-Piceetum</i> is a spruce forest type with a species-poor herb layer composed of the ericoid shrubs <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>, the grasses <i>Avenella flexuosa</i> and <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i> and acidophilous shade-tolerant ferns and herbs. The cover of the moss layer usually exceeds 50%; it is characterized by extensive mats of the hepatic <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>, hygrophilous mosses characteristic of initial peat formation on forest soil, e.g. <i>Polytrichum commune</i> and <i>Sphagnum</i> spp., and also bryophytes of mesic forest soils. It occurs at the bottoms of broad valleys and basins in the submontane and montane belts, most often in the altitudinal range of 700&ndash;1000 m. These habitats are characterized by high humidity and frequent accumulations of cold air. Many sites occur near the margins of mires and the water table is high. This association occurs in most mountainous areas of the Czech Republic, but in many cases it is only developed on a small scale.
LFD01;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Betula pubescens</i>, but other trees and shrubs adapted to wet acidic soils can also occur. The herb layer is often dominated by the grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i> while peatland species such as <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> and <i>V. uliginosum</i> are also common. The well developed moss layer is dominated by <i>Sphagnum</i> spp., accompanied by mosses typical of mineral forest soils. This vegetation develops on wet organic soils in mire complexes, usually in a mosaic of various types of open mire vegetation and coniferous peatland forests. Peatland birch forests develop on wetter sites than peatland pine forests. They often represent young stages of forest succession on peatlands, e.g. on margins of open mires or after disturbance of previously forested sites on peat. In the Czech Republic the stands of this association are scattered in mountain areas and basins with peatland formation.
LFD02;;;These are peatland forests dominated by <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>. Their canopy is denser than in the similar association <i>Sphagno-Pinetum sylvestris</i>, which belongs to the class <i>Oxycocco-Sphagnetea</i>. The herb layer contains a significant component of dwarf shrubs such as <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, <i>Rhododendron tomentosum</i>, <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>, <i>V. uliginosum</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>, accompanied by bog specialists. The moss layer contains <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. together with forest species of mineral soils. This is a terminal successional stage of bogs at low altitudes. Soils are either strongly mineralized peat or mineral soil with peat formation. The water table is usually 30 cm below ground or deeper. This association occurs in some mountain areas and basins in the Bohemian Massif.
LFD03;;;<i>Vaccinio-Pinetum montanae</i> is an association of closed peatland forest dominated by <i>Pinus uncinata</i> subsp. <i>uliginosa</i>. Its herb layer contains dwarf shrubs <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>, <i>V. uliginosum</i>, <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>, in places also <i>Rhododendron tomentosum</i>, and species typical of bogs. The moss layer is characterized by <i>Sphagnum recurvum</i> s. l. and other peat mosses, as well as mosses of mineral soils. It occurs in the same areas as the association <i>Ledo palustris-Pinetum uncinatae</i> of the class <i>Oxycocco-Sphagnetea</i>, but it is confined to sites with a lower water table, most often caused by artificial draining. The soil is partly mineralized peat. In the Czech Republic <i>Vaccinio-Pinetum montanae</i> occurs in some mountainous areas and basins of the Bohemian Massif, generally at higher altitudes than the association <i>Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetum sylvestris</i>.
LFD04;;;This association includes peatlands dominated by <i>Picea abies</i>, which on very wet peat soils form open low-growing stands, often with <i>Betula pubescens</i>. The herb layer is characterized by different species of <i>Vaccinium</i>, the grasses <i>Avenella flexuosa</i>, <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i> and <i>Molinia caerulea</i> and bog specialists. The moss layer has a cover of 80&ndash;100% in most stands and is dominated by peat mosses and other mire species. This association occurs on flat land and in shallow depressions in mountain areas, usually at the margins of open mires. In the Czech Republic this association has been reported from the mountain ranges along the state border within the Bohemian Massif.
MAA01;;;This association is dominated by low-growing annual graminoids (e.g. <i>Carex bohemica</i>, <i>Coleanthus subtilis</i>, <i>Eleocharis ovata </i>and <i>Juncus bufonius</i>) and dicots. It is most common on exposed fishpond bottoms, and less frequently it also occurs on sediment accumulations on river banks. This is the most moisture-demanding and most acidophilous association of the <i>Eleocharition ovatae </i>alliance. Usually it occurs on a 5&ndash;30 cm deep layer of wet, loamy to loamy-clayey mud. It is most frequent in mid-altitude areas of Bohemia and western Moravia.
MAA02;;;This association includes low-growing annual vegetation with <i>Cyperus fuscus</i> and <i>Juncus bufonius</i>, while <i>Cyperus michelianus</i> is rare in its stands in the Czech Republic. It occurs on periodically flooded river banks, in desiccating oxbows, on exposed bottoms of fishponds and fish storage ponds, in sand pits, banks of water reservoirs and in puddles. It is better adapted to substrate dessication than the association <i>Polygono-Eleocharitetum ovatae</i>, and it also occurs on substrates that are richer in calcium and salts. It occurs especially in warm lowland areas.
MAA03;;;This association occurs on fishpond margins, wet fields, dirt roads in precipitation-rich areas, and in sand pits. The habitat is usually flooded for a shorter time than in the other associations of the alliance <i>Eleocharition ovatae</i>. The most common substrate is acidic coarse sand, but the association also occurs on loamy-sandy or gravelly substrates with low pH. In the Czech Republic this association is most common in colline and submontane areas of the Bohemian Massif.
MAB01;;;This association includes open low-growing stands of moisture-demanding annual herbs on acidic, nutrient-poor soils. It is an endangered vegetation type, which has significantly declined during the 20th century due to application of fertilizers, liming and succession on abandoned land. The last time stands of this vegetation type were recorded in the Vla&#353;im region of central Bohemia and the T&#345;ebo&#328; region of southern Bohemia in the 1990s.
MAB02;;;This association includes open low-growing stands of wetland annual herbs. It was recorded on sandy substrates in fishpond margins and on the bottoms of fish storage ponds. The diagnostic species of this vegetation unit require a constantly wet substrate at least until the time of flowering, and sometimes the habitat is flooded by shallow water. This association was probably always rare in the Czech Republic, but it retreated from most of its historical localities (especially in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin) due to eutrophication and intensification of fishpond management. Both historical and recent localities are concentrated in southern Bohemia.
MAC01;;;This low-growing annual vegetation occurs in small-scale patches in periodically flooded depressions on arable land, around perennial puddles on dirt roads in agricultural landscapes, disturbed places in alluvial or saline grasslands, sand pits and bottoms of summer-dried fishponds. Soil is rich in calcium and salts. This vegetation has been recorded at a few sites in the warm lowlands of northern Bohemia and southern Moravia.
MAC02;;;This association includes low-growing stands with <i>Lythrum hyssopifolia</i>, <i>Myosurus minimus</i>, <i>Plantago uliginosa</i>, <i>Ranunculus sardous</i> and annual weed and ruderal species, which occur in periodically flooded depressions on arable land or recently abandoned fields. Most of these sites are flooded in precipitation-rich years and vegetation develops after drainage. Habitats are maintained by periodical disturbances, otherwise they are overgrown by tall perennial wetland plants, which results in the disappearance of competitively weak annuals. In the Czech Republic this community occurs in the Morava and Dyje floodplains and adjacent areas in southern Moravia and very rarely in southern Bohemia.
MAC03;;;This community includes dense to slighly open vegetation dominated by dicot herbs such as <i>Lythrum hyssopifolia</i>, <i>Mentha pulegium</i>, <i>Peplis portula</i><b>,</b> <i>Pulicaria vulgaris</i> and other species typical of wet grasslands. It is found on disturbed sites in floodplain meadows, along shores, on bottoms of sand, gravel or loam pits, on infrequently used dirt roads or in fish storage ponds. The habitat is flooded in spring by shallow water, which slowly drops and eventually dries out in summer. In the Czech Republic this association has been found mainly in the confluence area of the Morava and Dyje rivers in southern Moravia, but atypical stands also occur on some sites in southern Bohemia.
MBA01;;;This association is dominated by <i>Ranunculus sceleratus </i>or <i>Rumex maritimus</i>, annual wetland herbs which can reach a height of up to 1 m and a cover of 100%. It occurs mainly on the exposed bottoms of summer-dried fishponds, oxbows and water reservoirs. Substrate is usually deep, wet and nutrient-rich mud. It occurs in areas with moderately warm to warm and moderately wet climate in lowland and colline areas across the Czech Republic.
MBA02;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Bidens tripartita </i>or <i>Persicaria lapathifolia</i>, which often form dense species-poor stands up to 150 cm tall. It occurs on exposed fishpond bottoms, along the shores of water reservoirs, in fish storage ponds, on river banks and wet arable land. Most often substrate is loamy to clayey mud, in places with an admixture of sand, and typically also with high nutrient content. However, this vegetation may also develop on nutrient-poor sites, where stands tend to be shorter. It tolerates substrate desiccation, therefore it also occurs in regions with warm and dry summers. In the Czech Republic it is most frequent in fishpond areas, but it is also common elsewhere at low to mid-altitudes.
MBA03;;;This association is dominated by <i>Bidens cernua</i>. It occurs on the bottoms of summer-drained fishponds, fish storage ponds, oxbows, banks of small streams, ditches or channels. The substrate tends to be rich in nutrients, and is wet or flooded by shallow water. This type of vegetation can even occur in deep water, but it does not tolerate long-term substrate desiccation. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in colline areas across the country.
MBA04;;;The <i>Polygono brittingeri-Chenopodietum rubri</i> includes open, but in some cases also closed stands of annual nitrophilous herbs, most frequently <i>Persicaria lapathifolia</i>, in warm areas also <i>Xanthium albinum </i>s. l. On many sites it contains different neophyte species. This vegetation type is most typical of alluvial sediment accumulations on the banks of large rivers, but it also occurs along smaller streams, in oxbows, and on the exposed bottoms of fishponds and water reservoirs. Substrate is usually sand or gravel with a good nutrient supply. This vegetation occurs across the whole Czech Republic except in high mountain areas; it is most frequent in lowlands and warm colline areas.
MBA05;;;This vegetation, dominated by <i>Bidens radiata</i>, is confined to exposed fishpond bottoms, with an exception of rare occurrences in fish storage ponds and water reservoirs. It develops on deep, loamy, water-saturated mud, which is rich in nutrients but poor in base cations. In the Czech Republic its occurrences are concentrated to mid-altitudinal fishpond areas, while it is absent from dry lowlands and high mountain areas.
MBA06;;;This vegetation type is usually dominated by <i>Persicaria hydropiper </i>or the neophyte <i>Bidens frondosa</i>. It occurs on the banks of fishponds, water reservoirs, rivers and brooks, bottoms of fish storage ponds, seasonally flooded pools in river floodplains, ditches, channels, wet arable fields, and puddles on forest paths and clearings. Water retention is not persistent and soils tend to dry out quickly. It is poorer in nutrients than in other associations of the alliance <i>Bidention tripartitae </i>that are confined to muddy substrates. This vegetation type is common from lowland to submontane areas across the Czech Republic.
MBB01;;;This association includes species-poor stands of summer annuals dominated by <i>Chenopodium glaucum </i>and <i>C. rubrum</i>. It occurs on wet soils around barns, dung hills, depressions along puddles in villages, in places with agricultural waste water input, and on the exposed bottoms of nutrient-rich fishponds. In the past this kind of vegetation also occurred in saline pastures. This moderately thermophilous community occurs across lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic.
MBB02;;;This association is dominated by <i>Atriplex prostrata</i> subsp. <i>latifolia</i>. It occurs on periodically flooded sites around dung hills, in places with agricultural waste water input, in wet depressions in arable fields or saline grasslands, and on exposed fishpond bottoms. In the Czech Republic it occurs at scattered sites in the lowlands and colline areas.
MBB03;;;This vegetation, dominated by <i>Chenopodium ficifolium</i>, grows on the edges of dung hills, around silage pits and on organic soils of waste sites. Soils are wet and rich in ammonium. It occurs mainly in warm agricultural areas, but more recently it has also spread to cooler areas.
MBB04;;;This association includes vegetation of different species of <i>Atriplex </i>and <i>Chenopodium</i>, including <i>Chenopodium chenopodioides</i>. It is a natural vegetation type of saline, periodically flooded soils, which rarely occurs in anthropogenic habitats. In the Czech Republic it has been only found on dried fishpond bottoms at a few sites in southern Moravia.
MCA01;;;This marsh is dominated by <i>Schoenoplectus lacustris</i>, a leafless species that forms sparse stands. It occurs in water depths of 40&ndash;60(&ndash;150) cm, i.e. deeper than is typical of other types of reed marshes. It often forms a discontinuous zone between the open water and littoral reed vegetation dominated by other species. <i>Schoenoplectetum lacustris</i> occurs in mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic wetlands, usually with a small proportion of organic sediment on the bottom, and often in recently disturbed or newly created water bodies. It is scattered across lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic.
MCA02;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Typha angustifolia</i> occur in the littoral zones of fishponds, flooded sand pits and pools in stone quarries, oxbows in early stages of terrestrialization, ditches and lentic sections of rivers. These wetlands are usually mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, with water 20&ndash;60(&ndash;100) cm deep. <i>T</i>. <i>angustifolia </i>is typical of early successional habitats with mineral substrate on the bottom and it usually disappears as organic sediment accumulates. It occurs in lowlands and colline areas throughout the Czech Republic, with rare occurrences in submontane areas.
MCA03;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Typha latifolia</i> occur in different types of mesotrophic to eutrophic wetlands, such as littoral zones of fishponds and water reservoirs, oxbows and alluvial pools, sand pits in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, lentic sections of rivers, ditches, channels and flooded depressions on arable land. Water depths are usually within the range of 10&ndash;60(&ndash;100) cm, but the habitat can dry out in summer. In contrast to early successional <i>Typhetum angustifoliae</i>, this association is confined to habitats in a later stage of wetland succession, which are characterized by accumulation of organic sediment on the bottom. <i>Typhetum latifoliae </i>occurs in lowland to submontane areas across the Czech Republic.
MCA04;;;This association includes tall, dense reed beds of <i>Phragmites australis</i>, a grass with a broad ecological range, occurring in oligotrophic to eutrophic, acidic to basic, and even brackish wetlands. It occurs in fishpond littoral zones, oxbows, alluvial pools, flooded pits, ditches, channels, on fluvial deposits, mire edges, abandoned wet meadows and flooded depressions on arable land. This kind of marshes is mostly found at a water depth of 10&ndash;50 cm, but it can also occur both in much deeper water or on sites that are not flooded at all. In the Czech Republic this is the most common vegetation type of marshes, occurring from the lowlands to montane areas.
MCA05;;;This marsh type is dominated by <i>Glyceria maxima</i>, a 1&ndash;2 m tall grass. It occurs in shallow, usually 0&ndash;30 cm deep water in eutrophic to hypertrophic wetlands, such as fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools, wet depressions in alluvial meadows, ditches, channels and slow streams. It tolerates significant fluctuations of water table, but is sensitive to deep flooding in the growing season. This association occurs in advanced stages of wetland succession, usually following the stands of <i>Phragmites australis</i> or <i>Typha </i>spp., and preceding the advent of sedge marshes. It occurs in lowland and colline areas across the Czech Republic, and locally also in submontane areas.
MCA06;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Sparganium erectum</i> occur in shallow, mesotrophic to eutrophic still water bodies in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, e.g. in fishpond littoral zones, pits, alluvial pools, flooded depressions in fields and meadows, and ditches and channels with slowly running water, as well as lentic sections on lower river courses. The water is usually 10&ndash;60 cm deep, but the habitat can dry out for short periods in summer. Stands of this association are usually of limited extent. They occur in lowland and colline areas across the Czech Republic.
MCA07;;;This association includes stands of <i>Acorus calamus</i>, a neophyte of eastern Asian origin, which has been deliberately introduced or has spread spontaneously into mesotrophic to hypertrophic wetlands, such as small fishponds, oxbows and alluvial pools. Water depths are 10&ndash;40(&ndash;100) cm. This vegetation occurs in lowland and colline areas across the Czech Republic.
MCA08;;;This association includes open stands of <i>Equisetum fluviatile </i>occurring mainly in shallow, mesotrophic still wetland habitats such as fishpond margins with accumulation of organic muddy sediment. Water depths are usually 30&ndash;70 cm, but this vegetation type can also develop in permanently wet but not inundated habitats such as depressions in meadows, brook alluvia or around springs. It does not tolerate complete substrate desiccation. In the Czech Republic this association occurs mainly in cool colline and submontane areas with acidic bedrock.
MCA09;;;This association includes marshes with <i>Typha shuttleworthii</i>, which usually forms small stands on sites flooded by shallow water or wet for most of the year. Habitats include the edges of mesotrophic to eutrophic fishponds, water reservoirs, depressions in wet meadows, alluvial pools, ditches and fluvial sediment accumulations. This rare community has been observed at only a few sites in the P&#345;&iacute;bram area of central Bohemia and in eastern Moravia.
MCA10;;;This association includes freshwater marshes dominated by <i>Bolboschoenus laticarpus</i> with an admixture of <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i> and some tall wetland graminoids. It is typical of large lowland rivers where it grows on gently sloping river banks, but also in oxbows, pools and channels. It is found in places with slowly running or still water, especially in places with fluctuating water table and periodic exposure of the bottom. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type has been documented mainly from the Labe river corridor, but it has been in decline in the past decades due to regulation of river flow.
MCB01;;;This brackish marsh is dominated by <i>Bolboschoenus maritimus</i> and some other species typical of saline soils. <i>B. planiculmis </i>also occurs in some stands, and occasionally it can become dominant. The association occurs in flooded depressions with brackish water in dry and warm areas, which dry out in summer. Less frequently it is found on the banks of shallow pools or around mineral springs. In the Czech Republic, it occurs at scattered sites in the lowland areas of western, northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
MCB02;;;Vegetation dominated by <i>Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani</i> used to be confined to the surroundings of mineral springs and the littoral zones of brackish lakes, but today it is mainly found in drainage ditches of former fens or salt marshes, and around pools in quarries and pits after extraction of peat, gravel or open cast coal mining. These habitats are usually flooded by shallow, mineral-rich water from autumn to spring, but they dry out in summer. This association occurs in lowland and warm colline areas in northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
MCC01;;;This association includes stands of <i>Oenanthe aquatica</i>, a large umbellifer with hollow stems. It occurs mainly in fishponds and still water bodies in river floodplains, especially on sites with an exposed bottom or sites flooded by shallow water (up to 5 cm). However, it can also grow in greater depths of up to 1 m. This association has benefited from fishpond eutrophication. It is common in fishpond basins and river floodplains in lowlands and colline areas, but it also occurs at some sites in submontane areas.
MCC02;;;This vegetation type, dominated by <i>Rorippa amphibia</i>, occurs in oxbows, alluvial pools, ditches, channels, on fluvial sediment accumulations and in lentic sections of rivers. It rarely occurs in fishponds and strongly eutrophicated water bodies with deep organic sediments. Water is usually 10&ndash;80 cm deep, but water table often drops far enough to expose the bottom in summer. This vegetation type occurs in lowlands and warm colline areas.
MCC03;;;This association includes stands of <i>Sagittaria sagittifolia </i>and/or <i>Sparganium emersum</i>. In still water both species usually occur in an emergent form, while in rivers they occur in a form with leaves that are partly submerged and partly float on the water surface. This vegetation type is typical of eutrophic water bodies such as fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools and lentic river sections. Water is usually 20&ndash;80 cm deep, but in streams it can be up to 120 cm deep. In summer water table can recede so far as to expose the bottom. Dominant species are capable of regeneration from their underground organs after a period of substrate desiccation. This association occurs in lowlands and colline areas.
MCC04;;;This vegetation type is represented by submerged aquatic stands of <i>Hippuris vulgaris </i>in deep water and emergent stands in shallow water or on exposed bottoms. It occurs in fishponds with calcium-rich and in some cases also brackish water. In the Czech Republic it occurs at a few sites in warm areas, but this is probably due to the rare occurrence of mineral-rich wetlands in cooler parts of the country. Outside the country it also occurs in cool areas. The number of localities in the Czech Republic has decreased due to eutrophication and the spread of competitively stronger wetland plants during recent decades.
MCC05;;;This type of marsh vegetation, dominated by <i>Scirpus radicans</i>, occurs in disturbed habitats with fluctuating water table, specifically in littoral zones of fishponds, alluvial pools and water reservoirs. Substrate is usually acidic and contains a high proportion of organic sediment. Populations of <i>S. radicans </i>often germinate on exposed fishpond bottoms, then spread through runners, but disappear in the next years if the water table raises again. This marsh type occurs mainly in cool colline areas such as the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands, T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin and elsewhere in southern Bohemia.
MCC06;;;These marshes are dominated by <i>Eleocharis palustris</i>, rarely also by <i>E. mamillata</i>. They occur in wetlands with a mineral bottom, often rich in calcium or brackish. Stands of <i>E. palustris </i>tolerate significant fluctuations of water table. They can be flooded for a long time in winter, and even in summer for a period of 2&ndash;4 weeks, but they can also survive periods of soil desiccation. Stands of <i>E. mamillata </i>are less tolerant to this kind of periodic desiccation, and are correspondingly distributed mainly in precipitation-rich areas. This association occurs from the lowlands to the mountain areas of the Czech Republic.
MCC07;;;This association includes stands of <i>Alisma plantago-aquatica</i>, occurring in shallow wetlands such as oxbows, alluvial pools, littoral zones of fishponds and water reservoirs, exposed bottoms of fishponds or fish storage ponds, and ditches. Habitats are typically mesotrophic to eutrophic and inundated by up to 50 cm deep water, but occurrences on wet non-inundated soil are also common. This community is typical of both early and advanced stages of terrestrialization; it declines with wetland desiccation or due to encroachment of tall marsh vegetation. Its localities are concentrated in precipitation-rich, mid-altitude areas of the Czech Republic.
MCC08;;;This association includes dense stands of <i>Alisma lanceolatum </i>in shallow water or open stands of this species on non-flooded, wet mineral soil. It occurs in alluvial pools, littoral zones of small fishponds, flooded sand pits, ditches and wet depressions in arable fields and meadows. It is confined to dry, continental areas, and tolerates wetland desiccation in summer better than <i>A. plantago-aquatica</i>. This association has been recorded in lowland areas of northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
MCC09;;;This association includes emergent stands of <i>Alisma gramineum </i>in shallow water or submerged stands of this species in deep water. It occurs in small fishponds with fluctuating water table or fish storage ponds, which are built on mineral-rich or calcareous substrate or artificially limed. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in southern Bohemia, and also in the Labe area and southern Moravia.
MCC10;;;Vegetation dominated by <i>Butomus umbellatus</i> occurs in fishponds, fish storage ponds, water reservoirs, small streams and lentic sections of large rivers. In cooler areas it is more abundant in still water bodies, while in warmer areas it occurs mainly in streams. However, these stands are rarely extensive along rivers with regulated water flow. Water table usually fluctuates, and if not, <i>B. umbellatus</i>­-dominated vegetation becomes overgrown by stands of tall reed species. This association occurs at scattered sites in lowlands and colline areas across the Czech Republic.
MCC11;;;This association includes species-poor freshwater marshes dominated by <i>Bolboschoenus yagara </i>or <i>B. laticarpus</i>, or both species occurring together. It occurs in the littoral zone of fresh water bodies such as fishponds and fish storage ponds with fluctuating water table. The substrate is usually acidic and nutrient-poor in stands of <i>B. yagara</i>, or slightly richer in stands of <i>B. laticarpus</i>, and can be flooded by up to 80 cm deep water, but at least for some periods of time the bottom is exposed. This vegetation type is most common in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin and adjacent parts of the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands, but scattered localities are also found elsewhere in the Czech Republic.
MCC12;;;This association includes marsh vegetation dominated by <i>Bolboschoenus planiculmis</i> and <i>B. laticarpus</i>, accompanied by annual or perennial wetland species and weeds of arable land. It occurs in persistent puddles which are flooded in spring and gradually dry out in summer, most frequently on arable land, but also in meadows, near water bodies or in abandoned sand pits. It has been recorded in lowland areas of northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
MCD01;;;The association <i>Rorippo-Phalaridetum </i>includes vegetation dominated by <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>, which occurs on stream banks, especially in the middle reaches of rivers, where it can also colonize sand and gravel bars in the river channels. Unlike in the association <i>Phalaridetum arundinaceae</i>, the water table remains largely below the soil surface, with flooding restricted to only a few days nearly every year. When they do occur, floods are strong, disturbing vegetation and removing fine particles from the substrate. This association is common in colline and submontane areas across the Czech Republic, and rarely occurs also on disturbed sites along lowland rivers.
MCD02;;;Vegetation dominated by the tall sedge <i>Carex buekii</i> occurs on the middle and lower courses of rivers. It is confined to loamy-sandy fluvial sediments on river banks, which are not directly exposed to the current. Usually this association occurs behind the zone of riverine reed vegetation dominated by <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i> (<i>Rorippo-Phalaridetum arundinaceae </i>association), which directly adjoins the stream. It is found on terraces and levees that are a few dozen centimetres above the mean annual water level. These habitats are occasionally flooded, but for a shorter period than the stands of <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>. This vegetation type occurs along different rivers in lowland to submontane areas of the Czech Republic.
MCD03;;;Vegetation dominated by <i>Calamagrostis pseudophragmites</i> occurs on gravel bars of submontane fast flowing rivers. The gravel bars are situated above or at the mean annual water level. The vegetation can be disturbed by strong but brief floods that cause erosion and translocation of accumulated sediments to elsewhere in the floodplain. This vegetation occurs on the Ostravice river in north-eastern Moravia and the Jizera river in eastern Bohemia. In the past it also occurred along other eastern Bohemian rivers.
MCE01;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Glyceria fluitans</i>, a wetland grass occurring in small fishponds, fish storage ponds, along brooks and ditches, in puddles on forest roads, oxbows and alluvial pools, periodically inundated depressions on arable land, and in shallow, lentic sections of rivers. <i>Glyceria fluitans</i>-dominated stands usually occur in wet or shallowly flooded sites, but they can also develop in deep water, where they are submerged or floating on the water surface, and rooted on the bottom or on the bank. The nutrient status of the water ranges from oligotrophic to eutrophic. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type is most common in cool and precipitation-rich colline and submontane areas with acidic bedrock.
MCE02;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Glyceria notata</i>, usually accompanied by some other grasses. It occurs on sandy sediment accumulations along small streams, disturbed springs in meadows, in puddles along dirt roads in forests or open landscape, and on exposed fishpond bottoms. It is most frequent in places flooded by up to 8 cm deep running water. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type occurs mainly in areas with base-rich bedrock.
MCE03;;;This association is dominated by the umbellifer <i>Berula erecta</i> and occurs in brooks and shallow pools. It occurs in three different morphological forms: (1) upright, emergent stands in shallow water or on wet banks; (2) stands with leaves floating on the water surface in deep, slow streams; or (3) submerged stands with strongly branched stems in fast streams. The water in which this community is found tends to be rich in nutrients, calcium and dissolved oxygen. Submerged parts of <i>B. erecta </i>and other species intercept and accumulate organic material and mud, and significantly contribute to terrestrialization. This association is most common in lowlands in the northern part of Bohemia.
MCE04;;;This association is dominated by <i>Nasturtium officinale</i>, rarely also by <i>N. microphyllum</i> or <i>N.&times;sterile</i>. It occurs in brooks, channels, ditches, pools and small fishponds. The water is usually 5&ndash;40 cm deep, but the water table can recede to expose the bottom for short periods, provided that the substrate remains wet. In deep moving water <i>Nasturtium </i>stands can float freely on the water surface. This association occurs in lowland areas with base-rich bedrock, most frequently in central Bohemia, and also in eastern Bohemia and southern Moravia.
MCE05;;;This is a wet grassland community dominated by <i>Leersia oryzoides</i>. It occurs in the littoral zones and on exposed bottoms of shallow water bodies such as fishponds and fish storage ponds, as well as in intermittently flooded habitats in floodplains. It does not tolerate substrate desiccation, or long-term flooding in a growing season by water deeper than 5 cm. Water is mesotrophic to eutrophic. This thermophilous community occurs mainly in lowlands and warm colline areas.
MCF01;;;This marsh type is dominated by <i>Carex pseudocyperus </i>and, less frequently, by the umbellifer <i>Cicuta virosa</i>. It occurs in mesotrophic to dystrophic, in some cases secondarily eutrophic habitats in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, e.g. fishpond littoral zones with accumulated organic sediment, oxbows, alluvial pools and pools in canopy openings of alder carrs. Water depth is usually less than 30 cm, but the water table can recede during the summer to expose the bottom; even when this happens, however, the substrate does not dry out. The association occurs from lowland to submontane areas of the Czech Republic, being more common in precipitation-rich areas.
MCF02;;;This marsh type is dominated by <i>Phragmites australis</i>, with participation of the wetland fern <i>Thelypteris palustris</i>. It is a rare vegetation type of mesotrophic fishponds, where is occurs as floating islets in 30&ndash;100 cm deep water. It has been recorded near Doksy in northern Bohemia and near Sob&#283;slav in southern Bohemia.
MCF03;;;This is a species-poor vegetation type dominated by <i>Calla palustris</i>. It occurs in mesotrophic to dystrophic habitats such as pools in alder carrs, fishpond littoral zones with peat accumulation and ditches. Occasional records are also from eutrophic habitats such as ponds in the centres of village squares. It is typical of advanced stages of terrestrialization, but <i>C. palustris </i>stands can also float on the water surface in littoral zones, which significantly contribute to accumulation of organic sediment. This community is distributed in precipitation-rich, moderately warm to cool colline and submontane areas of the Czech Republic.
MCG01;;;This association includes marshes dominated by the conspicuous tussocks of <i>Carex elata</i>, occurring in mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic, still water. The habitat is richer in nutrients than in the other associations of the alliance, and consequently fen species are less frequent. Water regime is characterized by deep flooding in spring with fluctuations during the rest of year. This vegetation type occurs in river floodplains and fishpond basins.
MCG02;;;This association includes species-poor marshes dominated by the tall sedge <i>Carex rostrata</i>. Fen species <i>Menyanthes trifoliata </i>and <i>Potentilla palustris </i>often co-dominate. Moss layer is absent or sparse. This vegetation type is common on acidic substrates in fishpond littoral zones. The water regime is relatively stable with slight overflooding for most of the year. The association occurs in moderately cool colline and submontane areas of the Czech Republic, especially in the Bohemian Massif.
MCG03;;;These marshes are dominated by <i>Carex lasiocarpa</i>, which reaches a height of up to 150 cm and forms species-poor stands along the shores of fishponds and in depressions on peaty soils. Water table is slightly above the soil surface for most of the year. Nutrient content is extremely low, whereas mineral content can vary. Currently this vegetation type is rare and endangered, occurring at a few sites in moderately warm to moderately cool areas of the Czech Republic.
MCG04;;;This marsh type is dominated by compact tussocks of <i>Carex cespitosa</i>, which are slightly inundated over most of the growing season. The moss layer is poorly developed or absent. The high water level and the absence of a moss layer differentiate <i>Comaro-Caricetum cespitosae </i>from the wet meadow association <i>Caricetum cespitosae</i>. <i>Comaro-Caricetum</i> is rather rich in species compared to the other associations of the alliance, especially owing to meadow and fen species occurring on the elevated tussocks of the dominant sedge. This vegetation occurs on acidic and neutral substrates with high peat content in the upper soil layer. It has been recorded only in western Bohemia.
MCG05;;;This marsh type is dominated by <i>Carex diandra</i>, and often contains <i>Menyanthes trifoliata </i>and <i>Potentilla palustris</i>. It occupies fishpond littoral zones and depressions in mires with water slightly inundating the soil surface over most of the growing season. Soils are characterized by their high carbon content and extremely low concentration of nutrients compared to the other associations of the alliance <i>Magno-Caricion elatae</i>. In the Czech Republic this association is very rare; it has probably disappeared at some sites from where there are historical records.
MCG06;;;This type of marsh vegetation is characterized by the tall tussocks of <i>Carex appropinquata</i>, which are accompanied by other tall sedges such as <i>C. acutiformis. C. diandra </i>and <i>C. rostrata</i>. It occupies peaty soils in mesotrophic littoral zones of fishponds, drainage ditches and depressions in mire complexes. The water regime is rather stable with water table near the soil surface. It is a rare vegetation type, occurring at only a few sites in the Czech Republic.
MCG07;;;This marsh type is dominated by the tall grass <i>Calamagrostis canescens</i>. It occurs on both mineral and peaty soils in reed vegetation zones around fishponds and in wet meadow and mire complexes. It is inundated for short periods by water up to 20 cm deep. On the shores of fishponds it usually occurs between the zone of tall sedges and adjacent non-flooded areas. Stands of <i>C. canescens </i>may occur naturally as advanced stages of the terrestrialization processes, but they may also develop on drained peatlands. This association is most common in the basins of southern Bohemia, but it also occurs elsewhere in lowland to submontane areas of the Czech Republic.
MCG08;;;This species-poor type of marsh vegetation is dominated by dense stands of the tall sedge <i>Cladium mariscus</i>, which is typical of calcareous fens in an advanced stage of terrestrialization. It occurs in water up to 100 cm deep, but can also be found in places where water is below the soil surface for most of the growing season. Natural habitats include puddles and the surroundings of springs in lowland fen complexes, however, it also occurs in man-made habitats such as wet pits in calcareous bedrock. This is a relict vegetation type, which used to be more common in lowland fens in the early Holocene, but has retreated due to loam sedimentation and the draining and conversion of fens into arable land. Currently it is found at four sites in the middle Labe area between M&#283;ln&iacute;k and Lys&aacute; nad Labem.
MCH01;;;This species-poor marsh vegetation, dominated by the tussock sedge <i>Carex paniculata</i>, occupies fishpond littoral zones with water rich in calcium and nutrients. Water table is high and relatively stable. <i>Caricetum acutiformi-paniculatae</i> is natural vegetation type which does not require any management to remain stable. It is distributed in mid-altitude areas with calcareous bedrock.
MCH02;;;This marsh type, dominated by <i>Carex acutiformis</i>, occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic wetlands such as littoral zones of fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools, river banks, floodplains of small streams, ditches, depressions in wet meadows and canopy openings in alder carrs. The soil is base-rich, organic or mineral, and it is wet or inundated with up to 5 cm deep water for most of the year. Occurrences of this association are concentrated in lowlands and warm colline areas of the Czech Republic.
MCH03;;;This marsh type is dominated by the tall sedge <i>Carex acuta</i>. It occurs in shallow, eutrophic, or less frequently mesotrophic wetlands such as in the littoral zones of fishponds, water reservoirs, oxbows, alluvial pools, fish storage ponds, river banks, ditches and shallow depressions in meadows. Water depth is usually up to 10 cm, but the water table can drop below the soil surface for long periods in summer. The substrate is usually poorer in base cations than in other associations of the alliance<i> Magno-Caricion gracilis</i>. This vegetation type is common in lowlands and mid-altitudes of the Czech Republic; it also occurs in some submontane areas.
MCH04;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Carex vesicaria</i> occur in shallow mesotrophic to eutrophic wetlands such as the shores of fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools, the floodplains of small streams, in ditches and in wet depressions in meadows. These habitats are usually inundated by water up to 20 cm deep, but the water table can drop below the soil surface for some periods in summer. <i>Caricetum vesicariae </i>has the highest moisture requirements of the associations of the alliance <i>Magno-Caricion gracilis</i>. It is accordingly most common in precipitation-rich areas. Occurrences of the association in the Czech Republic are concentrated in cool colline and submontane areas.
MCH05;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Carex disticha</i> occur in shallow depressions in wet meadows, on the edges of oxbows and alluvial pools, in outer zones of the shores of fishponds, and in wet ditches. Soils are usually mineral, rich in nutrient and bases, in some places slightly saline. The soil surface is flooded for a few days or weeks in spring, but it can dry out for long periods in summer. This association occurs in lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic.
MCH06;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Carex riparia</i> occur mainly in the floodplains of large rivers, while they are rare in fishponds. Their habitats include the banks of rivers and artificial channels, ditches, sand pits, oxbows, alluvial pools and wet depressions in floodplain meadows. <i>C. riparia </i>stands are flooded for only a brief period in spring, but flooding can be deep. The water table gradually recedes by June or July, and then the soil can dry out considerably. In the Czech Republic localities of <i>Caricetum ripariae </i>are concentrated in lowland river corridors.
MCH07;;;Marshes dominated by <i>Carex vulpina</i> occur in shallow depressions in floodplain meadows, oxbows and alluvial pools in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, and rarely also on the edges of small fishponds and wet ditches. Soils are usually heavy and clayey, and rich in potassium and phosphorus. <i>C. vulpina </i>stands are flooded for a few days or weeks in spring, but later in the growing season the water table can drop even a few dozen cm below the soil surface. This vegetation type is most common in dry and warm lowlands and colline areas, but it also occurs in wetter and cooler areas.
MCH08;;;The association <i>Phalaridetum arundinaceae</i> includes dense stands of reed canary grass, <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>, occurring in complexes of marsh vegetation in lowland river floodplains and in the littoral zones of still water bodies. It occurs in shallow depressions, oxbows in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, along ditches with slow-moving water or on the banks of flooded sand pits. In contrast to the association <i>Rorippo-Phalaridetum arundinaceae</i>, habitats of <i>Phalaridetum arundinaceae </i>are flooded longer, remain constantly wet, are not directly affected or disturbed by currents, and grow on fine-grained sand or silt. Strong accumulation of litter contributes to the development of organic soil. This association can also occur in floodplains of middle river courses, where it grows in depressions that are distant from the river channel. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type is common from lowlands to mid-altitudes.
RAA01;;;This community, dominated by <i>Carex remota</i>, develops in springs shaded by a forest canopy, with intermittent water supply, which leads to a higher representation of mesophilous forest species than in the other associations of the alliance <i>Caricion remotae</i>. The herb layer is moderately rich in species, while the moss layer is rather species-poor, and in some cases suppressed by tree litter. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type occurs from colline to montane areas.
RAA02;;;This association occurs in springs under canopy openings of beech and spruce forests. Both the herb and moss layers are well developed. Soils tend to be muddy with high admixture of undecomposed humus and litter. The vegetation of this association is better supplied by ground water than that of the association <i>Caricetum remotae</i>, and it more often occurs at higher altitudes. Its localities are concentrated in the submontane to montane areas of the Czech Republic.
RAA03;;;This community of forest springs is characterized by a well-developed herb layer and the dominance of <i>Chrysosplenium oppositifolium</i>. It occurs mostly on steep slopes in beech forests with a closed canopy. Soils are stony or gravelly due to eluviation of small soil particles. Ground water has an acidic or neutral reaction and stable temperature over the year. In contrast to the two previous associations, species richness is lower and bryophytes are more suppressed by tree litter. This vegetation type has suboceanic distribution and reaches its eastern limits in the Czech Republic. It occurs in moutainous areas of Bohemia.
RAB01;;;This vegetation type occurs in forest springs with calcium carbonate precipitation. Species richness of vascular plants is usually very low, and it decreases as the amount of calcium carbonate precipitation increases. Bryophytes mostly predominate over herbs. A well-developed moss layer can significantly increase calcium carbonate precipitation due to high carbon dioxide uptake from water for photosynthesis. In the Czech Republic, this vegetation has been recorded at low and middle altitudes on calcium-rich bedrock.
RAC01;;;This vegetation type of well-insolated springs dominated by <i>Montia hallii </i>and <i>M. fontana </i>occurs in slow-moving water with low to intermediate calcium content in the montane belt. <i>Montia </i>species are poor competitors, and this vegetation type is endangered across Europe due to increasing eutrophication and associated spread of competitively superior species. In the Czech Republic it occurs rarely in mountain areas.
RAD01;;;This association represents an initial stage of succession of subalpine spring vegetation. It occupies springs supplied by cold and oxygenated ground water with very low mineral content. It is characterized by low species richness and the dominance of bryophytes over vascular plants. In the Czech Republic, it occurs on steep walls of glacial cirques in the Krkono&#353;e and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains.
RAD02;;;This association includes subalpine spring vegetation developing on soils with higher organic content compared to the association <i>Crepido paludosae-Philonotidetum seriatae</i>. Herb layer is richer in species, mostly dominated by <i>Swertia perennis </i>and<i> Allium schoenoprasum</i>. This vegetation occurs only in the Krkono&#353;e and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains.
RAD03;;;This association, dominated by <i>Cardamine amara </i>subsp. <i>opicii</i>, occurs in springs and on stream banks in the subalpine belt or in the canopy openings of montane spruce forest. Species richness is negatively related to the cover degree of <i>C. a. </i>subsp. <i>opicii</i>, which can also strongly suppress the moss layer. The association occurs throughout the whole of the Carpathians and reaches its western distribution limit in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains.
RBA01;;;This association includes vegetation of calcareous fens, dominated by short sedges and developed on organic fen peat. These fens are usually of modern origin, and they are developed and maintained under regular mowing regimes or light livestock grazing. Species of wet <i>Calthion palustris </i>meadows and acidophytes occur in many stands. <i>Carex davalliana</i> is present on most sites and usually dominates. The moss layer is species-poor and lacks both the <i>Sphagnum </i>species and brown mosses typical of other associations with <i>Carex davalliana</i>, e.g. <i>Palustriella commutata</i> or<i> Scorpidium cossonii</i>. Localities of this association in the Czech Republic are concentrated in the eastern Labe lowland and adjacent foothill areas, and in foothills of the &#353;umava Mountains.
RBA02;;;This sedge-moss vegetation type is developed on calcareous tufa springs, which occur in warm areas with calcium-rich bedrock, such as in the south-western part of the Moravian Carpathians and central Bohemia. In the upper soil layers, both marl and calcium carbonate prevail over organic peat. The phosphorus availability is extremely low. This vegetation usually occurs around small springs scattered within a mosaic of mown grasslands. It is formed of short wetland sedges, cotton grasses and bryophytes, of which <i>Palustriella commutata</i> is present on most sites and usually dominates.
RBA03;;;This association is vicarious to the <i>Valeriano dioicae-Caricetum davallianae</i> in the mountainous regions of the Western Carpathians, which are colder and less calcium-rich than the areas of distribution of the <i>Carici flavae-Cratoneuretum filicini</i>. The substrate is mostly shallow organic peat overlying a gley layer. The association occurs throughout the flysch zone of the Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian Carpathians. In the Czech Republic it occurs only fragmentarily. As in the <i>Carici flavae-Cratoneuretum filicini</i> association, <i>Eriophorum latifolium </i>frequently dominates. <i>Scorpidium cossonii</i>, a frequent dominant of the moss layer of this association in the Western Carpathians, occurs at only a few sites in the Czech Republic.
RBA04;;;This association is characterized by both the fen species with boreal distribution, considered to be glacial relicts, and the species requiring stable water regime and deep peat. The vegetation consists of short fen sedges (including <i>Carex davalliana </i>on some sites), tall fen sedges (<i>C. diandra </i>and<i> C. lasiocarpa</i>), broad-leaved wetland plants (<i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>) and brown mosses such as <i>Campylium stellatum </i>and<i> Scorpidium cossonii</i>. The substrate is a deep water-saturated peat, without precipitated calcium carbonate. The association contains many rare and endangered species such as <i>Eriophorum gracile. Pedicularis palustris </i>and <i>Hamatocaulis vernicosus</i>. It occurs at a few sites in the Doksy region of northern Bohemia, the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands, and northern Moravia.
RBA05;;;This association occurs in the most calcium-rich fens in the Hercynian part of the Czech Republic, which are located in the Cretaceous bedrock area of central Bohemia. Tussocks of <i>Schoenus.ferrugineus </i>or <i>S. nigricans</i> dominate the vegetation. Short sedges and other fen specialists grow between the tussocks. The moss layer is species-poor or absent. The vegetation tends to be stressed by phosphorus and iron deficiency, high salt content and fluctuating water regime with seasonal desiccation of the upper soil layers.
RBA06;;;This species-poor vegetation type, dominated by <i>Eleocharis quinqueflora</i>, represents an initial successional phase at water-saturated and disturbed patches of calcareous fens. The moss layer may be absent due to frequent disturbance or high water table. It is more common in limestone areas of the Alps and Carpathians, while in the Czech Republic it is rare and fragmentarily developed in small patches in the flysch zone of the Western Carpathians and in central Bohemia.
RBB01;;;This is the species-richest association within the class <i>Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae </i>in the Czech Republic, in both the herb and moss layer. The most frequent dominant species are the reddish peat moss <i>Sphagnum warnstorfii</i> and the cotton grass <i>Eriophorum latifolium</i>. Brown mosses such as <i>Scorpidium cossonii</i> may occur in wet depressions within a matrix of hummocks and carpets of calcium-tolerant peat mosses. In contrast to other associations of the alliance <i>Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis</i>, this association lacks several boreal species while it may contain some species with temperate distribution, such as <i>Carex davalliana</i>. Currently it occurs especially in fen grasslands that are mown for hay, from cool colline to montane areas in the Czech Republic.
RBB02;;;This association is dominated by short sedges, and often by <i>Trichophorum alpinum</i>. <i>Rhynchospora alba </i>may reach high cover values. This vegetation type is less productive than that of other associations of the alliance <i>Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis</i>, containing fewer grasses and broad-leaved plants due to lower nutrient availability and permanent saturation with water or periods of shallow inundation. Moss layer is dominated by brown mosses such as <i>Hamatocaulis vernicosus </i>and<i> Scorpidium cossonii</i>, among which the calcium-tolerant peat moss <i>Sphagnum contortum </i>is frequently admixted. Peat layer is usually shallow. In the Czech Republic, <i>Campylio-Trichophoretum </i>occurs in the T&#345;ebo&#328; basin and the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands. Ecologically similar fen habitats also occur in other regions, but they do not contain diagnostic species of this association, probably due to historical reasons.
RBB03;;;This vegetation type is composed of short and tall sedges, including species with boreal distribution range, such as <i>Carex chordorrhiza. C. diandra</i> and <i>C. lasiocarpa</i>, brown mosses and calcium-tolerant peat mosses. Other species of water-saturated habitats, such as <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>, are also frequently present. This vegetation type frequently occurs on deep, old sediments and may persist if unmanaged for a long time due to high water level. In unmanaged stands, willows may form a sparse shrub layer. This vegetation contains several endangered species and glacial relicts. It has a boreal distribution which extends south to central Europe. In the Czech Republic it occurs rarely in the Kru&#353;n&eacute; hory Mountains, &#268;esk&yacute; r&aacute;j area, southern Bohemia and Bohemian-Moravian Uplands.
RBC01;;;This association represents one of the most common types of fen grasslands on non-calcareous bedrock in central Europe. Both productivity and species richness are rather high in the context of fen habitats, but the representation of both the high pH-specialists and boreal species is very low. The vegetation is usually dominated by common species of short sedges such as <i>Carex demissa. C. echinata. C. nigra</i> and <i>C. panicea</i>, the peat mosses <i>Sphagnum subsecundum </i>and <i>S. teres </i>and common non-sphagnaceous mosses. The peat layer is usually shallow and calcium concentrations are low. The association is widespread in submontane to montane areas of the Czech Republic.
RBC02;;;This association includes disturbance-tolerant vegetation of moderately-rich fens with low primary productivity, dominated by <i>Rhynchospora alba </i>and species of <i>Sphagnum </i>sect. <i>Subsecunda</i>, and containing suboceanic species. It differs from the association <i>Campylio stellati-Trichophoretum alpini</i> in the absence of calcicolous species, and from the association <i>Sphagno recurvi-Caricetum rostratae</i> in the absence of <i>Sphagnum </i>sect.<i> Cuspidata</i> as a dominant species group. This vegetation occurs in fens on fishpond and lake margins and on water-saturated sandy soils. The peat layer is shallow, with a large proportion of mineral soil fraction. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium are low. This association is most common in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin, and further it occurs rarely in the vicinity of the towns of Jind&#345;ich&#367;v Hradec and Doksy.
RBC03;;;This association occurs in moderately-rich fens which are poorer in calcium than floristically and ecologically similar fens of the <i>Menyantho trifoliatae-Sphagnetum teretis</i> association. This is reflected in a lower representation of calcicolous species. The vegetation is composed of short and tall sedges, including species with a boreal distribution such as <i>Carex chordorrhiza </i>and <i>C. diandra</i>, as well as several endangered species and glacial relicts. <i>Calliergonella cuspidata </i>and<i> Sphagnum teres</i> are the most common dominant species of the moss layer. The association is mainly distributed in north-western Europe, and in the Czech Republic it occurs predominantly in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin (fens at fishpond margins), the Doksy area and the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands.
RBC04;;;This association occurs in small subalpine springs and represents a mixture of fen and spring species. Stands are low and sparse, dominated most often by <i>Allium schoenoprasum</i>, <i>Carex flava. C. vaginata. Molinia caerulea </i>s. str., <i>Swertia perennis </i>or <i>Trichophorum alpinum</i>, while <i>Carex nigra </i>is poorly represented at the Czech localities. Fen mosses of the genera <i>Scorpidium</i>, <i>Sphagnum </i>and<i> Warnstorfia </i>are usually present. The vegetation is rich in vascular plants, mosses and liverworts. Sites in the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains have higher calcium concentrations and contain also some calcicolous species, while sites in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains are characterized by the occurrence of <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i>. The association contains some species considered as glacial relicts.
RBC05;;;This association of moderately rich fens is very poor in both vascular plant and bryophyte species. The stands are usually dominated by <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>, <i>Trichophorum cespitosum </i>and <i>Warnstorfia sarmentosa</i>. Grasses and broad-leaved dicots are absent, and peat mosses are not dominant. Concentrations of calcium are lower than in the previous association. Concentration of major nutrients in the environment and vegetation productivity are extremely low. The peat layer is shallow and grows very slowly. The association is typical of the tundra zone of northern Europe. In the Czech Republic it occurs only in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains at altitudes above 1300 m, often close to bog complexes.
RBD01;;;This association of poor fens is dominated by <i>Carex rostrata </i>and <i>Sphagnum recurvum </i>s. l. Other species of water-saturated habitats, such as <i>Equisetum fluviatile </i>and <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>, are also frequent. Occasionally, species with a boreal distribution (e.g. <i>Carex chordorrhiza </i>and <i>C. limosa</i>) may occur. This vegetation type is frequently found on fishpond and lake margins, in bog laggs and in floating fens. It may also occur in fen grasslands cut for hay. Concentrations of calcium are usually very low, while concentrations of iron are high. Peat depth may reach more than 1 m. The association is quite common in mire complexes on non-calcareous bedrock in the submontane and montane areas of the Czech Republic.
RBD02;;;This poor-fen association is characterized by dominance of tall sedge <i>Carex lasiocarpa</i>, which has a boreal distribution and may indicate long history of fen vegetation on particular sites. The vegetation is further composed of other tall sedges, tall dicot herbs, short sedges typical of poor fens, reed species and willows. <i>Sphagnum fallax </i>dominates the moss layer. The peat layer is deeper than in the previous association. The association occurs in the &#353;umava Mountains, T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin and the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands.
RBD03;;;This poor-fen association includes vegetation dominated by short sedges (e.g. <i>Carex echinata </i>and<i> C. nigra</i>), rushes and <i>Sphagnum recurvum </i>s. l. Grasses and broad-leaved herbs typical of managed wet grasslands are also common. This vegetation occurs in bog laggs, poor-fen margins and managed fen grasslands with a shallow peat layer. Calcium concentration is usually very low, but it may be higher if phosphorus, nitrogen or iron concentrations are enhanced. In the Czech Republic, this association is particularly common in the Moravskoslezsk&eacute; Beskydy Mountains, where it is the most common association of the class. However, it also occurs in other non-calcareous regions of the country.
RBD04;;;This association includes species-poor stands strongly dominated by <i>Molinia caerulea </i>s. str. and <i>Polytrichum commune</i>. Species requiring higher concentrations of minerals and nutrients, as well as species of ombrotrophic bogs, are rare or absent altogether. Water level decreases regularly below the root depth. Soil is acidic and calcium-poor, with a shallow peat layer. The association is abundant in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains at altitudes of 1000&ndash;1450 m, but it has also been recorded rarely at low altitudes, e.g. in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin.
RBE01;;;This community is formed of shallow-rooting species of vascular plants (e.g. <i>Carex limosa </i>and<i> Scheuchzeria palustris</i>), represented with a low cover, and bryophytes (mostly <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum </i>and <i>Warnstorfia fluitans</i>), reaching high cover values. It occupies hollows in the central parts of deep mountain bogs. This vegetation type is very poor in species, because of the small number of species in the Czech flora adapted to permanent inundation and the extremely low nutrient and mineral content and low water pH, which is often below 4 in this habitat. This association occurs in the mountain areas along the state borders of the Czech Republic.
RBE02;;;This association, dominated by <i>Carex rostrata</i> in the herb layer and <i>Warnstorfia fluitans </i>in the moss layer, occurs in hollows at bog margins (laggs) and on shallow peat. It represents an initial phase of bog development. Water is very acidic and poor in minerals and nutrients. Shallow peat supports the growth of some mineral-demanding species such as <i>Carex rostrata</i>, which root below the peat in the mineral bedrock. This association has been recorded in the Jizersk&eacute; hory, Krkono&#353;e, Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains.
RBE03;;;This suboceanic mire vegetation type occupies inundated hollows and their margins and is dominated by <i>Rhynchospora alba </i>in the herb layer, and <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and <i>S. tenellum</i> in the moss layer. In western Europe, it occurs on blanket bogs, whereas in the Czech Republic, it is found in mires near fishponds, in which the vegetation surface is isolated from the ground water by a deep peat layer. The water is thus poor in minerals and nutrients and has a low pH. This vegetation type is fragmentarily developed in central Europe and it lacks a number of subocenic species typical of western European stands. In the Czech Republic this association occurs in the T&#345;ebo&#328; and Doksy Basins.
RCA01;;;Vegetation dominated by <i>Eriophorum vaginatum </i>tussocks occurs on bog margins partially supplied by oligotrophic ground water, pool margins, water-saturated bare peat of strip-mined mires, and poor fens isolated from ground water by a thick peat layer. Water is strongly acidic, with pH about 4, and poor in minerals. This vegetation type occurs in the boreal zone and in the mountains of temperate Europe in areas of subcontinental climate. In the Czech Republic it is found in mountain areas.
RCA02;;;This vegetation type is composed predominantly of dwarf shrubs and <i>Sphagnum magellanicum. S. rubellum </i>and<i> S. russowii </i>forming small hummocks. It occupies central parts of ombrotrophic bogs. Water level is permanently high. The peat typically consists of undecomposed peat mosses and branches of small shrubs. In the Czech Republic this vegetation occurs mainly in the mountainous areas of the Bohemian Massif along the international border.
RCA03;;;This association includes mountain bogs dominated by up to 2 m tall stands of <i>Pinus mugo </i>and <i>P. &times;pseudopumilio </i>reaching a cover up to 90 %. This vegetation occurs on shallower peat with a more strongly fluctuating water table than adjacent vegetation of open bogs. It often forms the border zone between open bogs and adjacent forests. In the Czech Republic this vegetation occurs in some mountain ranges of the Bohemian Massif along the international border.
RCA04;;;These continental and subcontinental wooded peatlands occur in lowlands and submontane basins of continental to subcontinental areas. They are dominated by <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, which creates an open canopy, with an admixture of <i>Betula </i>species and<i> Picea abies</i>. This vegetation occupies mesotrophic and oligotrophic bogs which are at least partially supplied by ground water. It is adapted to strong water fluctuations. In the Czech Republic it is rare, occurring at some sites at low to mid-altitudes of the Bohemian Massif.
RCA05;;;This wooded peatland, dominated by <i>Pinus rotundata</i>, occupies shallow depressions in deep mires at least partially fed by oligotrophic ground water. Trees are sparse. The herb layer is poorer in species than that of the previous two associations. The moss layer is well developed and composed of different <i>Sphagnum </i>species. This association occurs in some mountain ranges of the Bohemian Massif and in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin.
RCB01;;;This suboceanic, ombrotrophic bog vegetation type is characterized by the dominance of <i>Trichophorum cespitosum </i>tussocks in the herb layer and <i>Sphagnum papillosum </i>and<i> S. tenellum </i>in the moss layer. Many suboceanic species common in western Europe are absent in this vegetation in the Czech Republic, but some of them (e.g. <i>Erica tetralix </i>and <i>Lycopodiella inundata</i>) do occur in places. This vegetation occupies permanently wet sites, often situated near bog hollows. In the Czech Republic, this association mainly occurs in the Jizersk&eacute; hory Mountains, which receive the highest precipitation in the country.
RCC01;;;This association, dominated by <i>Trichophorum cespitosum </i>tussocks in the herb layer and <i>Sphagnum compactum </i>in the moss layer, occurs in bogs with a peat layer less than 1 m deep in the subalpine belt of the Krkono&#353;e Mountains. Shallow peat and fluctuating water table enable presence of some species from the adjacent subalpine grasslands. Water is acidic and mineral-poor.
RCC02;;;This bog community is remarkable on account of its tall <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> hummocks, occupied by small shrubs of <i>Calluna vulgaris </i>and <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i>. In the Czech Republic, stands of this association are poor in boreo-arctic species, of which <i>Oxycoccus microcarpus </i>is often the only species present. Species composition is thus similar to that of the <i>Sphagnion magellanici </i>communities. This vegetation occupies extensive areas only in the &#353;umava Mountains, but rare and fragmentary stands are also found in the mountain ranges of the northern Czech Republic.
SAA01;;;This is a calcicolous and slightly nitrophilous vegetation type of shaded sites, dominated by <i>Cystopteris fragilis</i>. This species, however, is not confined to calcareous substrata; it can also grow in other associations of <i>Asplenietea trichomanis </i>on acidic rock outcrops. Along with other small ferns, species of nutrient-rich forests are common. The more species-rich stands of this community are found on natural rock outcrops, where some rare relict species can be found. More common, yet species-poorer, are stands on walls and in other human-made habitats such as quarries.
SAA02;;;This is a community of walls and calcareous rock outcrops on dry, sunny or partially shaded sites. Its dominant species, <i>Asplenium ruta-muraria</i>, is well adapted to desiccation. It is accompanied by other small ferns with low cover. The most common habitats are walls containing mortar; they are usually characterized by the occurrence of slightly nitrophilous species. Natural habitats on calcareous rock outcrops contain some species of dry grasslands and <i>Sesleria caerulea </i>mats, while secondary stands in quarries are usually poor in species.
SAB01;;;This is an open vegetation type of serpentine outcrops with the serpentine specialist ferns <i>Asplenium adulterinum </i>and <i>A. cuneifolium</i>. It occurs in precipitation-rich submontane areas of the Bohemian Massif, where serpentine appears as an acidic rock due to cation leaching. This community is thus mainly composed of calcifuge species. Usually it is found on small outcrops in open pine forests.
SAB02;;;This association occurs on serpentine outcrops in warm and dry areas, where serpentine soils have neutral to slightly basic reaction due to low cation leaching. It is characterized by the occurrence of southern European fern <i>Notholaena marantae</i>, which reaches its northern distribution limit in central Europe. This vegetation type also includes the serpentine specialist fern <i>Asplenium cuneifolium</i> and several thermophilous species spreading from adjacent dry grasslands. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type is only found in the middle Jihlava river valley near the village of Mohelno in south-western Moravia.
SAC01;;;This association includes vegetation on sun-exposed and dry outcrops of acidic rocks. A typical species is <i>Asplenium septentrionale</i>, in some places accompanied by the rare fern <i>Woodsia ilvensis</i>. Other species mainly include widespread generalists of acidic soils, although some rare relict species can also be found in some places. This vegetation type is rarely encountered in some areas of the Bohemian Massif, most often in deep river valleys.
SAC02;;;This association includes vegetation on non-calcareous rock outcrops or stabilized but hardly soil-filled screes which contain the relict species <i>Saxifraga rosacea</i>. Most of these habitats are of natural origin and have been open for millenia. On some screes, this vegetation type occurs in places with streams of cold air emerging from the talus. It is found on several sites in northern and central Bohemia and very rarely in south-western Moravia.
SAC03;;;This vegetation type occurs on shaded outcrops of acidic siliceous rock such as sandstone, granite, gneiss or shale. It is usually dominated by <i>Polypodium vulgare</i> and contains species typical of the forest herb layer which are adapted to shaded conditions and low-pH soils. The moss layer is well developed, often in the form of continuous carpets of pleurocarpous mosses such as <i>Hypnum cupressiforme</i>. This vegetation type is rarely found in human-made habitats, except shaded dry-stone walls built without mortar. It is common in Bohemian sandstone areas and in deep river valleys of the Bohemian Massif.
SAD01;;;This is an open and species-poor vegetation type with the boreo-alpine, continental species Cryptogramma crispa, occurring on stabilized but not soil-filled screes of siliceous rocks. It occurs rarely in the subalpine to alpine belt of the glacial cirques in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains.
SBA01;;;This species-poor plant community dominated by <i>Cymbalaria muralis</i> occurs on sunny or partially shaded vertical surfaces of walls in warm areas of the Czech Republic, most frequently on castles and castle ruins, old urban fortifications, in chateau gardens, urban parks and garden suburbs. <i>C. muralis </i>is a species of southern European origin and occurs as an alien in the Czech Republic. In some places it has been deliberately planted but it tends to spread spontaneously to suitable habitats in its surroundings.
SBA02;;;This association includes species-poor vegetation of walls dominated by <i>Corydalis lutea</i>. Its stands can be both open and fairly closed. The species is light-demanding, but requires sufficient moisture at the same time. Therefore it is more frequently found on retaining walls than on drier free-standing walls. Unlike some other species of such habitats, it can grow on walls where concrete has been used as binding material, because the long roots of <i>Corydalis lutea </i>are able to penetrate into very narrow crevices. In the Czech Republic <i>Corydalis lutea </i>is an alien species of southern European origin, which has been often planted and in some places has escaped from gardens or parks. Its stands occur at lower and middle altitudes across the country, both in cities and villages, as well as on solitary castles.
SCA01;;;This association is dominated by the small fern <i>Gymnocarpium robertianum</i>, which forms a branched rhizome spreading extensively within the scree. It occurs on mobile or intermittently stable screes formed of limestone, hard claystone or base-rich volcanic rocks. This vegetation type is more common on screes of natural origin than on anthropogenic screes. Its Czech localities are concentrated in the Bohemian Karst and Moravian Karst, but it is rarely found also in other areas with screes of base-rich rocks.
SCA02;;;This association includes open stands on well insolated, mobile screes, in which rock fragments are mixed with humus-poor fine soil. The dominant species, <i>Galeopsis angustifolia</i>, is accompanied by other short-lived plants, such as <i>Microrrhinum minus</i>. This vegetation type is typical of quarries, embankments and other anthropogenic screes. In natural conditions it preferentially occurs on upper parts of larger scree slopes where rock fragments tend to be smaller and mixed with fine soil.
SCA03;;;This association includes calcicolous scree vegetation dominated by the grass <i>Melica ciliata</i>, which is accompanied by <i>Teucrium botrys </i>and several thermophilous species of dry grasslands. It has been recorded at a single site in the Czech Republic: a marble scree slope near the village of Horn&iacute; Dunajovice in south-western Moravia. In the past the open character of this site and scree movement had been probably supported by grazing; now it is threatened by encroachment of bushes and <i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>.
SCB01;;;This vegetation type, dominated by <i>Galeopsis ladanum</i>, grows on both anthropogenic and natural screes consisting of various sedimentary, metamorphic and volcanic rocks with acidic to neutral reaction. Often the screes are mixed with fine soil, which can occasionally be more compacted than in the case of the association <i>Galeopsietum angustifoliae</i>. The dominant species is accompanied by calcifuge species of ruderal habitats, dry grasslands and forests. This association occurs in different areas of the colline and submontane belt of the Bohemian Massif, being more common in western Bohemia; however, it is poorly documented by relev&eacute;s.
TAA01;;;This association typifies low-growing annual grasslands dominated by <i>Crypsis aculeata,</i> which develop on wet saline soils. It was documented from three sites in southern Moravia in the 1960s, but there are no newer records of well developed stands, although small remnant populations of <i>Crypsis aculeata</i> still persist.
TAA02;;;These low-growing, open annual grasslands, dominated by <i>Heleochloa schoenoides</i>, are typical of exposed lake bottoms with saline soils. The soils contain a large proportion of clay. They are wet in spring but dry out in summer. Occasionally stands of <i>Heleochloa schoenoides</i> occur in vernally flooded depressions on arable fields. Currently this vegetation is only found at two sites in southern Moravia, although in the past it was probably more common in that part of the country.
TBA01;;;This association includes open, species-poor stands of <i>Salicornia prostrata</i>, confined to strongly saline soils in the surroundings of mineral springs and saline lakes. In the past it occurred at a few sites of southern Moravia, but the last stands disappeared in the 1970s.
TBA02;;;The association <i>Spergulario-Suaedetum</i> includes open, species-poor stands of <i>Suaeda prostrata</i>, occurring on similar (albeit nitrogen-richer) soils as <i>Salicornietum prostratae.</i> In the past it was found in several localities of southern Moravia, but it disappeared in the 1970s.
TCA01;;;This association includes open low-growing grasslands dominated by <i>Puccinellia distans</i> (<i>P. limosa</i> does not occur in the Czech Republic). They are found in drier parts of saline sites that are flat or slightly elevated and do not contain wet depressions. Soils are slightly wet in spring, but dry out in summer. These grasslands were traditionally grazed or trampled. They occurred in several places in the dry lowlands of southern Moravia, but only four localities are still extant.
TCB01;;;This saline grassland is dominated by <i>Juncus gerardii</i> or some other halophytes. It is the richest in halophytes of all the Czech saline grasslands. It was formerly found in shallow depressions around mineral springs or on the margins of saline water bodies in southern Moravia. Today its last remnants exist in moist places near villages.
TCB02;;;<i>Loto-Potentilletum</i> is the most common saline grassland type of the Czech Republic, but it lacks most of the specialized halophytic plants, and the core of its species composition consists of facultative halophytes. Earlier it was found near saline springs and at communal pastures around villages. Today it is typical of trampled sites such as village football grounds. It is distributed in dry lowlands of northern and central Bohemia as well as in southern Moravia.
TCB03;;;This association is typical of slightly moist, saline soils with frequently disturbed surface. It occurs in wet depressions, such as around mineral springs and temporarily flooded habitats in arable fields as well as around small pools in places disturbed by heavy vehicles. It is found in dry areas of northern Bohemia (Oh&#345;e river basin) and in southern Moravia.
TDA01;;;This association includes stands of a widespread and common meadow type dominated by tall grass <i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i>. The stands occur on mesic, nutrient-rich or fertilized soils at lower to middle altitudes. These meadows are mown twice, occasionally three times a year.
TDA02;;;This association of <i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i> dominated meadows occurs on slightly drier and more nutrient-poor soils than the <i>Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris.</i> It is most common in low-lying, warm colline landscapes across the Czech Republic, but it is absent from higher altitudes. Management includes mowing for hay once or twice a year.
TDA03;;;This association of mesic meadows includes stands at higher altitudes, usually on more acidic and nutrient-poor soils than in the habitats of <i>Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris.</i> At higher altitudes, <i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i> becomes less abundant than in the warm lowlands and low-altitude colline landscapes, which results in the increase of relative proportion of the biomass of medium-tall grasses such as <i>Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra</i> agg. and <i>Trisetum flavescens</i>.
TDA04;;;These species-rich meadows, dominated by <i>Festuca rubra</i> agg., are found on river terraces that are wet in spring but dry out in summer. They are mown once a year and left without artificial fertilization. In the past such light-use meadows were more common, but these became rare in recent decades. Most current localities are found along the Berounka river in western and central Bohemia. Scattered stands are also found elsewhere in the country.
TDB01;;;These montane meadows are co-dominated by several species of medium-tall grasses, in combination with the broad-leaved montane herb <i>Geranium sylvaticum</i>. They are found on nutrient-rich soils in the montane belt, originally occupied by herb-rich beech forests. They are most common in the Krkono&#353;e, Jizersk&eacute; hory and Orlick&eacute; hory Mountains, but scattered stands are also found in other mountain ranges of the Bohemian Massif.
TDB02;;;This association includes meadows of the montane belt in the Krkono&#353;e Mountains, which also rarely occur in the lower part of the subalpine belt near the timberline. There is also one historical record from the Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains. When compared to <i>Geranio sylvatici-Trisetetum flavescentis,</i> these meadows are more typical of higher altitudes and contain some alpine species, e.g. <i>Campanula bohemica, Phleum rhaeticum</i> and <i>Potentilla aurea</i>. Due to higher precipitation at higher altitudes, soils are leached and have low pH.
TDB03;;;This association is dominated by less nutrient-demanding, medium-tall grasses, combined with <i>Meum athamanticum</i> and other species of suboceanic distribution. It occurs on acidic and nutrient-poor soils in the montane belt of the Kru&#353;n&eacute; hory Mountains. Some sites were also recorded in the Jizersk&eacute; hory and western Krkono&#353;e Mountains.
TDC01;;;This association includes low-growing stands of nutrient-demanding, disturbance-adapted species on rich mesic soils. They are managed either as intensive pastures for cattle and other domestic animals or as frequently cut lawns in city parks. Compared to the pastures, the city lawns are poorer in species due to the absence of some grazing-adapted plants. Although plant biomass is frequently removed from pastures (but not from city lawns), there is also the high nutrient input, which supports post-disturbance regeneration. This vegetation type is distributed throughout the Czech Republic, although it has not been well documented with relev&eacute;s.<b>
TDC02;;;This association includes extensive pastures on dry, nutrient-poor and base-rich soils on flysch on the fringes of the Western Carpathians. Besides the species of mesic grasslands, they also contain some species of semi-dry grasslands and <i>Nardus stricta</i> grasslands. Most localities have been recorded in the Host&yacute;nsk&eacute; vrchy and B&iacute;l&eacute; Karpaty Mountains.
TDC03;;;These are species-poor grasslands dominated by the low-growing grass <i>Lolium perenne</i> or the rosette hemicryptophyte <i>Plantago major</i>. They are found in frequently trampled places on paths, around buildings, on play grounds and in recreational areas. This association is common throughout the Czech Republic from lowlands up to the montane belt, but is not documented by relev&eacute;s from all areas.
TDC04;;;This association includes species-poor communities of trampled habitats on forest roads and paths across meadows and forest clearings. They occur in half-shaded to sunny habitats on slightly moist soils. The dominating species include alien <i>Juncus tenuis</i> in heavily disturbed habitats and <i>Prunella vulgaris</i> in less frequently trampled places. They are common in forested areas from the colline to montane belts across the Czech Republic.
TDC05;;;These are low-growing perennial grasslands dominated by <i>Poa supina</i> found on mesic to slightly wet soils on paths and other trampled habitats in the montane belt of the Czech mountain ranges. Although they are not very common, their distribution is probably larger than reflected by the existing relev&eacute;s.
TDD01;;;This association includes meadows of nutrient-poor, intermittently wet soils which regularly contain calcium carbonate. They are usually dominated by <i>Molinia arundinacea</i> or <i>M. caerulea</i>, but these species may be absent from some stands. It is distributed from lowlands to submontane areas in different parts of the Czech Republic, most commonly in southern and central Bohemia.
TDD02;;;This association includes meadows on intermittently wet and nutrient-poor soils which are more acidic than in the previous association. It is distributed in higher colline and submontane altitudinal belts, but it appears to be absent from the lowlands. The stands are usually dominated by <i>Molinia arundinacea</i> or <i>M. caerulea</i>, which are accompanied by species of intermittently wet soils as well as those typical of wet oligotrophic habitats. This meadow type is most common in southern and central Bohemia and in the &#268;eskomoravsk&aacute; vrchovina Uplands.
TDE01;;;These are highly productive meadows dominated by <i>Alopecurus pratensis</i> that mainly occur in the floodplains of large lowland rivers as well as in broad floodplains of smaller streams at higher altitudes. Unlike the physiognomically similar stands with sown <i>Alopecurus pratensis</i>, they are confined to regularly flooded sites and contain several moisture-demanding species. The water table does not recede in summer to the same extent as in other associations. Accordingly, the soils do not dry out for longer periods and most species with pronounced continental distribution ranges are missing.
TDE02;;;<i>Holcus lanatus</i> dominated meadows are developed in places that are shallowly flooded in spring and remain wet in the first part of the growing season. They become mesic in summer due to lowering of the ground water table. When compared with the association <i>Poo trivialis-Alopecuretum pratensis</i>, <i>Holcetum lanati</i> is less common in lowlands, being mostly distributed in the floodplains of smaller streams at the upland fringes. The development of <i>Holcus lanatus</i> stands is often supported by disturbance, such as large flood events.
TDE03;;;This association occupies shallow depressions and habitats with impeded outflow of flood waters in the floodplains of the Dyje and Morava rivers in the dry region of southern Moravia. Spring floods may last for several weeks and the habitat remains wet for a rather long period after the flood water retreat. This favours moisture-demanding species, some of which are otherwise typical of tall-sedge stands. However, owing to the dry local climate soils dry out in late summer. Such conditions support the occurrence of several species with continental distribution. Inter-annual variation in moisture influences the proportions of different dominant species.
TDE04;;;This association includes flooded meadows along large rivers in dry lowlands. These meadows are found in slightly higher places within the floodplain microtopography than those of the association <i>Lathyro palustris-Gratioletum officinalis</i>. Spring floods accordingly last only for a few days and summer drought is more pronounced. The stands of this association contain several species showing continental distribution. In the Czech Republic this vegetation is restricted to the floodplains of the Dyje and Morava rivers in southern Moravia.
TDE05;;;This association includes tall-herb meadows in the floodplains of lowland rivers which are mown irregularly only in some years, or even abandoned for a few years. Under such conditions tall herbs such as <i>Pseudolysimachion maritimum</i> appear and become increasingly frequent. Soils and flooding regime of these meadows are similar to those of the <i>Cnidio dubii-Deschampsietum cespitosae.</i> These meadows are mainly found along the Labe river in central and eastern Bohemia as well as the Dyje river in southern Moravia.
TDF01;;;This association occurs in wet places that are well supplied with nutrients and bases. Such productive habitats support development of herbaceous stands dominated by <i>Cirsium oleraceum</i>, which have the highest biomass of all mown types of <i>Calthion palustris</i> meadows. They are distributed throughout the Czech Republic, but they appear most commonly at middle altitudes.
TDF02;;;Wet meadows with <i>Cirsium rivulare</i> are restricted to the eastern part of the Czech Republic. They are most frequent in the flysch mountain ranges of the Western Carpathians and in the N&iacute;zk&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k Mountains of northern Moravia. Like the <i>Angelico sylvestris-Cirsietum oleracei</i> meadows, they are confined to soils that are well supplied with nutrients and bases. On the flysch bedrock, they are frequently found around springs and in seepage habitats.
TDF03;;;This association includes wet meadows on acidic, base-poor soils, which are common on the siliceous bedrocks at medium and higher altitudes of the Bohemian Massif. They are absent from lowlands and the flysch-dominated regions of the Carpathians. Persistent water-logging supports development of a rich moss layer and impedes biomass decomposition, resulting in formation of a shallow peat layer covering the soil surface. These meadows are often spatially and successionally linked to fens.
TDF04;;;These meadows occur on wet and base-poor soils. In some places a luxuriant moss layer can develop and a shallow peat layer may form on the soil surface. In contrast to the <i>Angelico sylvestris-Cirsietum palustris,</i> these meadows contain several species of suboceanic distribution, including the dominating <i>Juncus acutiflorus</i>. They are rather common in a restricted submontane region of northern Bohemia, but small isolated stands also occur at higher altitudes of the southern part of the Bohemian Massif.
TDF05;;;This wet meadow type is dominated by the continental species <i>Cirsium heterophyllum</i>. It occurs in seepage areas in the montane belt of most mountain ranges of the Bohemian Massif, being most common in the Krkono&#353;e, Jizersk&eacute; hory, &#353;umava and Novohradsk&eacute; hory Mountains. Soils are acidic, with low calcium status.
TDF06;;;These montane wet meadows, usually dominated by <i>Chaerophyllum hirsutum</i>, occur in partially shaded places around springs. Throughout the year soils are strongly saturated with water. Some stands consist of natural herbaceous vegetation developed in wet canopy openings, while others are occasionally mown. The association occurs in the montane belt of all high mountain ranges of the Czech Republic.
TDF07;;;Wet meadows with <i>Cirsium canum</i> occur at lower altitudes, in warmer and drier areas. Soils are heavy, well saturated with bases, in some places also slightly saline, and drier than in other associations of the alliance <i>Calthion palustris</i>.
TDF08;;;Vegetation dominated by <i>Scirpus sylvaticus</i> occurs on wet, usually slightly acidic soils. Due to their poor suitability for hay making, these grasslands are usually mown only where they occur in a mosaic with more valuable meadow types. They are common in montane and submontane areas throughout the Czech Republic.
TDF09;;;The tussock-forming sedge <i>Carex cespitosa</i> forms large hummocks that are difficult to mow, and thus most of its stands are unmanaged. Soils are wet and rich in bases and nutrients. This vegetation type occurs in drier and warmer areas than most of other associations of the alliance <i>Calthion palustris</i>. Scattered localities are found in colline landscapes at fringes of the Bohemian Massif.
TDF10;;;Species-poor grasslands dominated by <i>Carex brizoides</i> develop from abandoned wet meadows on acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Strong litter accumulation is a characteristic feature, preventing establishment of most species and delaying succession of woody vegetation. Some of these stands remain in a relatively stable state for several decades. This vegetation is distributed at middle altitudes of the Bohemian Massif, and it is rather common in southern, western and northern Bohemia.
TDF11;;;These wet grasslands, dominated by <i>Juncus inflexus</i> and <i>Mentha longifolia</i>, are found in disturbed places, usually around springs in pasture complexes where vegetation is trampled by grazing animals. Soils are base-rich, usually rather heavy, with a high clay content and in some places also appear as slightly saline. This vegetation is common in the flysch Carpathians, particularly in the areas with calcareous bedrock and base-rich mineral springs. Rare and isolated occurrences are also found in other areas with calcareous bedrock, especially in northern and central Bohemia.
TDF12;;;This wet tall-forb grassland type dominated by <i>Filipendula ulmaria</i> develops after abandonment from mown meadows of the alliance <i>Calthion palustris</i> on base- and nutrient-rich soils. It is widespread across the country, with the exception of dry lowlands and the highest mountain areas.
TDF13;;;This association includes species-poor tall-forb grasslands dominated by <i>Filipendula ulmaria</i>. They develop from abandoned meadows in persistently wet habitats, often in the littoral zone of water bodies. Soils are usually poorer in calcium than in the case of the previous association. This vegetation type occurs scattered across the Bohemian Massif and it is most common at middle altitudes.
TDF14;;;This species-poor, tall-forb grassland type dominated by <i>Filipendula ulmaria</i> occurs in all the higher mountain ranges of the Czech Republic, where it is mainly found in the montane belt. It is confined to wet soils in seepage habitats and along brooks, developing from abandoned wet meadows of the alliance <i>Calthion palustris</i> or from logged alder forests.
TEA01;;;This species-poor community dominated by <i>Nardus stricta</i> occurs in the high mountain ranges, mostly at deforested sites below the timberline. It is confined to acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often on convex landforms. In the past these stands were occasionally mown but not fertilized. Vegetation change and forest succession after abandonment in secondary habitats is very slow. This vegetation type occurs in the Krkono&#353;e, Orlick&eacute; hory, Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and &#353;umava Mountains.
TEA02;;;This association includes species-rich grasslands dominated by <i>Nardus stricta</i> or <i>Avenella flexuosa</i> which constitute the natural vegetation at the edges of glacial cirques in the Krkono&#353;e, Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains. The habitats supporting this vegetation type are richer in nutrients than those of the association <i>Festuco supinae-Nardetum strictae</i>. In some places this vegetation also develops at deforested sites below the timberline.
TEB01;;;These are species-rich secondary grasslands of the montane belt in the Krkono&#353;e, and rarely also in the Kru&#353;n&eacute; hory Mountains. They contain species of alpine, subalpine, montane and submontane meadows and those of oligotrophic grasslands. Traditionally they used to be mown once a year, with subsequent grazing.
TEC01;;;This is a species-rich, low-growing grassland dominated by <i>Nardus stricta</i>. It occurs on nutrient-poor soils over acidic bedrocks such as granite, gneiss and sandstone. It is found in the submontane and montane belts of all mountain ranges of the Czech Republic. Traditionally these grasslands were grazed or mown, but today most of them have been abandoned and are disappearing due to nutrient enrichment and subsequent spread of more strongly competitive, nutrient-demanding species.
TEC02;;;These grasslands are dominated by <i>Festuca rubra</i> agg. They occur on nutrient-poor, moderately dry soils which are disturbed by erosion on steep slopes, by grazing animals or by burning. Most of these stands were used as pastures, but some were also occasionally mown for hay. This association usually occurs in smaller patches rather than in extensive stands. It is distributed in submontane and montane belts of all mountain ranges of the Czech Republic.
TED01;;;These species-poor grasslands of <i>Juncus squarrosus</i> and <i>Nardus stricta</i> occur in shallow wet depressions or on the edges of mires. The soils are wet, acidic and poor in nutrients. Such conditions support development of a rich moss layer and at some sites they are also conducive to processes of peat formation. The community is found in precipitation-rich areas of the Czech Republic and it is most common in northern and north-western Bohemia. It also occurs in the T&#345;ebo&#328; basin of southern Bohemia and elsewhere in the mountains.
TEE01;;;This association includes dry heathlands dominated by <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and containing drought-adapted herbs, mosses and lichens. It occurs on acidic, nutrient-poor and shallow soils over sand or hard rocks such as granite, gneiss and sandstone. Traditionally the stands were grazed by sheep or goats and perhaps occasionally burned as well. This vegetation is more common in dry colline landscapes and lowlands of central Bohemia and south-western Moravia. Isolated stands have also been recorded in other areas with lower precipitation.
TEF01;;;This association includes heathlands dominated by <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and accompanied by <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> and <i>V. vitis-idaea</i>. They occur on acidic, nutrient-poor soils in submontane and montane belts. Most stands are secondary at deforested sites, but some stands of this vegetation may occur naturally on rock outcrops. They are distributed in most mountain ranges of the Czech Republic, and occasionally also at low altitudes, where they mostly occur on cooler north-facing slopes.
TEF02;;;This association includes submontane and montane heathlands dominated by <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>. At most sites the heathlands replace acidophilous forests as secondary vegetation. In some places they may represent the natural vegetation in canopy openings on rock outcrops. This association is distributed in all mountain ranges of the Czech Republic.
TEF03;;;This association includes subalpine heathlands dominated by <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>. In winter the heathlands are covered by a deep, continuous snow cover, which protects <i>Vaccinium</i> against frost and strong winds. They occur in areas around and above the timberline in the Krkono&#353;e, Hrub&yacute; Jesen&iacute;k and Kr&aacute;lick&yacute; Sn&#283;&#382;n&iacute;k Mountains, where they can locally cover extensive areas. Isolated stands of <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> heathland containing some high-mountain species are also found in other mountain ranges.
TFA01;;;This association of open <i>Corynephorus canescens</i> grasslands is typical of acidic sand dunes. Most of these dunes originated in places of large-scale disturbances such as forest clearings, pastures, sand pits or on military training grounds. Recurrent disturbance at an interval of every few years is necessary for this vegetation type to persist and to prevent succession towards closed grassland. Most localities are found on the terraces of the Labe river, in sandstone-dominated areas of northern Bohemia, and near Hodon&iacute;n in southern Moravia.
TFA02;;;This association of <i>Corynephorus canescens</i> grasslands occurs on slightly less acidic sand dunes than with the <i>Corniculario aculeatae-Corynephoretum canescentis</i>. In addition to the species of suboceanic distribution, it also contains several continental (sarmatic) species. It occurs in sandy areas along the Labe river; one historical occurrence was also recorded from southern Moravia.
TFB01;;;Species-poor stands of the low-growing annual grass <i>Aira praecox</i> occur on acidic sandy soils with a slightly higher content of humus and fine soil particles than is typical of sand dunes. The habitats are usually trampled or disturbed in the top soil. This association is most frequent in areas with suboceanic climate and poor sandy deposits, especially in the Doksy region of northern Bohemia. It has been also rarely recorded along the Labe river, in the T&#345;ebo&#328; basin of southern Bohemia, and elsewhere.
TFB02;;;Open vegetation with the annual grass <i>Vulpia myuros</i> occurs at disturbed sites over sandy or gravelly deposits, e.g. in sand pits, disturbed sites near villages, trampled habitats and places in-between tracks in railway stations. It is scattered in dry lowlands and colline landscapes.
TFC01;;;This is a <i>Festuca brevipila</i> dominated grassland, occurring on sandy soils at disturbed sites, such as trampled or mown lawns in and around villages, along roads, on playgrounds, margins of pine forests, and on military training grounds. It is most common in sandy areas along the Labe river and in the Doksy region of northern Bohemia, but scattered localities are also found on terraces of other rivers and on sandy deposits derived from weathered granite in different parts of the Bohemian Massif.
TFC02;;;This association includes sand grasslands dominated by <i>Festuca ovina</i> occurring in the sand area near Hodon&iacute;n in southern Moravia. In contrast to <i>Sileno otitae-Festucetum brevipilae</i>, it contains some species of the Pannonian flora. In the local succession of sand grasslands, this association replaces pioneer grasslands with <i>Corynephorus canescens</i> on consolidated sand dunes.
TFD01;;;This is an open vegetation type of rock outcrops with the prostrate perennial herb <i>Scleranthus perennis</i> and drought-adapted acrocarpous mosses <i>Ceratodon purpureus</i> and <i>Polytrichum piliferum</i>. It is confined to very shallow soils disturbed by erosion and in some places also by trampling. It occurs in moderately dry areas of the Bohemian Massif, particularly in central and southern Bohemia and south-western Moravia.
TFD02;;;These <i>Festuca ovina</i> dominated grasslands are composed of moderately thermophilous and drought-adapted species which readily spread into dry pastures across the cultural landscapes of mid-altitudes. They are confined to shallow soils over hard siliceous bedrocks. Most localities are found in colline and submontane belts of the Bohemian Massif in central and southern Bohemia and south-western Moravia. Some occurrences have also been recorded elsewhere on nutrient-poor acidic soils.
TFE01;;;This is a vegetation type of open swards with <i>Veronica dillenii, V. verna</i> and some other vernal therophytes adapted to dry and acidic soils. It occurs in small patches near rock outcrops, at sites influenced by soil erosion, and in disturbed places within acidophilous dry grasslands. It occurs most frequently in warm, dry colline landscapes of the Bohemian Massif in central Bohemia and western Moravia. It is also rarely found in the moderately cool areas where it is confined to well-insolated rocky slopes of river valleys.
TFF01;;;The <i>Cerastietum</i> is a community of calcicolous vernal therophytes with a phenological optimum in late April and early May. It forms a part of vegetation complexes of dry grasslands on limestone and other calcareous bedrocks, where it is confined to disturbed patches and the vicinity of rock outcrops. It is found in areas with dry, warm climate in northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia.
TFF02;;;This association includes communities of succulents, mainly <i>Sedum album</i> and <i>S. acre</i>, and vernal therophytes on limestone and other calcareous rocks. It occurs both on natural rock outcrops as well as in quarries. In contrast to the association <i>Cerastietum</i>, its stands contain more succulents and less therophytes. The association is most common in colline landscapes of northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia, but isolated occurrences are also found in other areas with warm, dry climate.
TGA01;;;This species-rich sand grassland type occurs at the north-western distribution limits of the alliance <i>Festucion vaginatae</i> and it is transitional towards the alliance <i>Corynephorion canescentis</i>. Its stands are dominated by <i>Festuca vaginata</i> subsp. <i>dominii, Corynephorus canescens,</i> and in places, <i>Stipa borysthenica</i>. Unlike most other communities of the <i>Festucion vaginatae</i>, they occur on base-poor acidic sands. In the Czech Republic they are restricted to a few sites in the sand area near Hodon&iacute;n in southern Moravia, where they develop from initial <i>Corynephorus canescens</i> grasslands on slightly consolidated sand dunes.
THA01;;;This association includes open stands of <i>Festuca pallens</i>, <i>Aurinia saxatilis</i> subsp. <i>arduini</i> and some other thermophilous perennial herbs, growing in crevices of steep cliffs and on small ledges on siliceous rocks. It is common on the volcanic hills of the &#268;esk&eacute; st&#345;edoho&#345;&iacute; in northern Bohemia and in deep river valleys of central Bohemia and south-western Moravia. Some isolated and usually species-poor stands are also found in river valleys in other areas of the Bohemian Massif.
THA02;;;The <i>Seselio-Festucetum pallentis</i> comprises open grasslands of <i>Festuca pallens</i> and other drought-adapted thermophilous species on outcrops of limestone or base-rich siliceous rocks. It is found on the volcanic hills of northern Bohemia and the valleys of the Berounka and Vltava rivers in central Bohemia.
THA03;;;This association includes dry, open grasslands dominated by <i>Allium senescens</i> subsp. <i>montanum</i> on outcrops of limestone or base-rich siliceous rocks. It occurs on the volcanic hills of the &#268;esk&eacute; st&#345;edoho&#345;&iacute; in northern Bohemia and in river valleys of central Bohemia and the south-eastern fringes of the Bohemian Massif.
THA04;;;This association includes dry grasslands dominated by <i>Festuca pallens</i>, occurring on gentle slopes of small granitic or gneiss hillocks. In the past these grasslands were used for low-intensity grazing, leading to local soil erosion, which fostered long-term maintenance of this vegetation type. The range of this association is restricted to the warm, dry region along the upland fringes of the Bohemian Massif in southern Moravia.
THB01;;;The association <i>Poo-Festucetum pallentis</i> includes open, low-growing dry grasslands with <i>Festuca pallens</i>, occurring on south-facing limestone outcrops in the Pavlovsk&eacute; vrchy hills in southern Moravia.
THC01;;;This is a drier type of <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> grasslands which includes a number of dry grassland specialists but only few dealpine species. At some sites it constitutes the natural vegetation of rock outcrops, but it is also found in secondary habitats, where it had extended under the influence of grazing. It usually occurs on limestone and rarely also on base-rich siliceous rocks such as basalt. It is most common in the Bohemian Karst and in the Vltava valley near Prague. Some sites are found in dry areas of northern Bohemia and in the Svratka valley near Ti&#353;nov.
THC02;;;This is an association of <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> grasslands occurring on limestone slopes of the Pavlovsk&eacute; vrchy hills in southern Moravia. It is rich in dry grassland species and also contains several species distributed on the limestone fringes of the Alps and Carpathians which are absent from other <i>Sesleria</i> grasslands of the Czech Republic.
THC03;;;This association includes both open and closed <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> grasslands occurring on north-facing cliffs and rocky slopes which are more humid and cooler than habitats of the other associations of the alliance <i>Diantho lumnitzeri-Seslerion</i>. This association also contains more species of higher altitudes. It occurs on limestone and base-rich siliceous bedrocks in the Bohemian Karst and adjacent areas of central Bohemia, at some isolated sites in the dry area of northern Bohemia, in the Moravian Karst, south-western Moravian river valleys and the Pavlovsk&eacute; vrchy hills in southern Moravia.
THC04;;;This is an endemic association of <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> grasslands occurring on serpentine outcrops in the middle Jihlava valley in south-western Moravia. It contains some serpentine specialists such as <i>Asplenium cuneifolium</i>. Most of the formerly grazed stands have been overgrown by encroaching pine, and all that is left are some small patches in canopy openings.
THD01;;;This vegetation type is dominated by the narrow-leaved tussock-forming grasses such as <i>Festuca valesiaca</i> and <i>Stipa capillata.</i> It contains many generalist species of central and eastern European dry grasslands, but several species of continental steppe are also present, e.g. species of the genus <i>Astragalus</i>. It occurs on south-facing slopes in warm, dry areas of northern and central Bohemia and in southern Moravia, mostly on deep soils over loess and on soft calcareous sediments, occasionally also on limestone or basalt. These grasslands have been traditionally subject to grazing, however, today most of them are abandoned.
THD02;;;This dry grassland type is dominated by the short narrow-leaved tussock-forming grass <i>Festuca valesiaca</i>. It contains several species typical of dry areas of northern and central Bohemia which are absent in Moravia, e.g. <i>Anthericum liliago, Erysimum crepidifolium</i> and <i>Lactuca perennis.</i> It mostly develops on steep, south-facing slopes with shallow soil and near outcrops of limestone, calcareous shale, basalt or other base-rich rocks. On upper parts of large slopes, this type of steppe vegetation may have existed continuously since the Late Glacial, maintained by combination of factors such as local dry climate and grazing. At some other sites, these grasslands are secondary, occupying potential habitats of thermophilous oak forests. This association occurs in dry areas of northern and central Bohemia.
THD03;;;This grassland type is dominated by the tussock-forming graminoids <i>Carex humilis</i> and <i>Festuca rupicola</i>, and it contains a suite of dry grassland generalist species. It occurs in warm, dry areas of northern and central Bohemia as well as in southern and central Moravia. Its stands are confined to slightly cooler or wetter habitats than would be the case of other associations of <i>Festucion valesiacae</i>. Soils are usually shallow to moderately deep, developed on both base-rich and slightly acidic bedrocks. It is a secondary vegetation type developed in habitats potentially supporting thermophilous oak or oak-hornbeam forests. This is traditionally grazed grassland. After abandonment it is affected by encroaching shrubs and spread of tall grasses such as <i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i>.
THD04;;;This association includes stands dominated by <i>Stipa pennata</i> or <i>S. pulcherrima,</i> rarely also by <i>S. smirnovii</i> and <i>S. zalesskii</i>. It is found on south-facing slopes in warm, dry areas of northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia. It occurs on shallow to moderately deep soils, mainly over base-rich rocks, such as basalt, limestone, calcareous sandstone or conglomerate. At some sites it is the natural vegetation of forest-steppe vegetation complexes, while elsewhere it has developed after deforestation. Some <i>Stipa</i> stands rapidly regenerate after burning or spread into abandoned fields or landslides. More intensive grazing leads to an increase of cover of <i>Stipa capillata</i>, forming transitions to the association <i>Festuco valesiacae-Stipetum capillatae</i>.
THD05;;;This dry grassland is dominated by <i>Stipa tirsa</i> and contains species of both the meadow steppe and dry steppe. Within the <i>Festucion valesiacae</i>, it occupies the least dry sites on gentle slopes or footslopes, usually covered by deep calcareous soils. It is a relict of the vegetation of the Pleistocene steppe on plains in dry lowlands &ndash; a great rarity today since it has been converted into arable land in most areas of original distribution. It is most common in the south-western part of the &#268;esk&eacute; st&#345;edoho&#345;&iacute; hills, in the middle Oh&#345;e valley of northern Bohemia and at a few sites in southern Moravia.
THD06;;;This is an open-steppe vegetation type at disturbed sites of recent landslides, abandoned fields or around rabbit colonies. It occurs on south-facing slopes in the warm, dry region of southern Moravia, usually over loess or calcareous sand or sandstone. Such habitats are colonized by competitively weak continental steppe plants, such as <i>Astragalus exscapus, Crambe tataria, Iris pumila</i> and <i>Taraxacum serotinum.</i> After several years of succession, vegetation of the formerly disturbed sites would develop into a closed grassland of the alliance <i>Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati</i> or <i>Festucion valesiacae</i>, and the species of open loess steppe would disappear. However, they may rapidly colonize newly disturbed habitats nearby.
THE01;;;These are semi-closed to closed dry grasslands mostly dominated by <i>Brachypodium pinnatum</i> or <i>Bromus erectus.</i> Usually they occur on gentle, south-facing slopes with heavy calcareous soils over Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments. In most places this vegetation develops at sites potentially supporting thermophilous oak or hornbeam forests. It was traditionally grazed or mown for hay, but most sites became abandoned. This grassland is widespread in lowlands and along adjacent upland fringes of northern, central and eastern Bohemia, as well as of central, eastern and southern Moravia.
THE02;;;These <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> dominated grasslands occur on steep slopes at low altitudes of northern and central Bohemia. The soils usually developed over Cretaceous marls, and are shallow, calcareous and strongly affected by erosion. Unlike the <i>Sesleria</i> grasslands of rock outcrops, this vegetation type contains several thermophilous species typical of deep, heavy soils. At some sites this is a natural vegetation on steep, erosion-prone slopes, from which this grassland may also spreads to adjacent, deforested and extensively grazed sites. Recent cessation of grazing in potential forest habitats has resulted in the spread of <i>Brachypodium pinnatum</i> at the expense of <i>Sesleria caerulea</i> and in a shift in species composition towards the association <i>Scabioso ochroleucae-Brachypodietum pinnati</i>.
THE03;;;These grasslands are usually dominated by <i>Brachypodium pinnatum</i> or <i>Inula ensifolia</i> and contain several continental species with their western distribution limit in southern Moravia, e.g. <i>Campanula sibirica, Jurinea mollis, Polygala major</i> and <i>Pulsatilla grandis</i>. They occur on south-facing slopes in dry colline landscapes of southern Moravia, mainly on moderately deep soils over calcareous flysch sediments. On some steep slopes affected by landslides, this vegetation may be considered as primary meadow steppe, but in most places it developed after deforestation of thermophilous oak or oak-hornbeam forests. Traditional management was the low-intensity grazing or occasional mowing. Today most sites are abandoned. At sites potentially supporting forests, shrubs and trees are slowly encroaching. In several places this dry grassland type has spread onto abandoned fields.
THE04;;;This grassland is usually co-dominated by <i>Bromus erectus</i> and <i>Carex flacca</i>, with a remarkable participation of the halophyte <i>Plantago maritima</i>. It occurs in the warm, dry area of north-western Bohemia with less than 500 mm of annual precipitation. It is found on toe slopes covered by dry grasslands, in shallow depressions and near springs. Soils are heavy, clayey, developed over claystone, marl or colluvial sediments. They are wet in spring and early summer but dry out considerably in late summer. In the past this vegetation type has been extensively grazed by sheep and goats.
THF01;;;This grassland type is mostly dominated by <i>Brachypodium pinnatum</i> and contains less thermophilous species than other <i>Festuco-Brometea</i> associations. It occurs in cooler and wetter areas than other types of dry grasslands. Its localities in warm areas are mostly found on north-facing slopes. The soils supporting this grasslands are usually calcareous, developed over limestone or various calcareous sediments. It is a secondary vegetation type at sites of former beech, oak-hornbeam or oak forests. Traditional management was light grazing or mowing. Today most sites are abandoned.
THF02;;;These semi-dry grasslands of the B&iacute;l&eacute; Karpaty Mountains on the Czech-Slovak border are co-dominated by <i>Brachypodium pinnatum, Bromus erectus, Carex montana</i> and <i>Molinia arundinacea</i>. With 60&ndash;80 vascular plant species per 16&ndash;25 m&sup2; (and even more in places) it is the species-richest plant community of the Czech Republic. Stands are composed of species of meadows, dry grasslands, open forests and forest fringes, including species of intermittently wet soils. Soils are deep and heavy, developed on calcareous flysch sediments. These grasslands are replacing beech and hornbeam forests. Traditionally they have been mown for hay once a year, usually in summer, and occasionally grazed as well. After abandonment they decline due to rapid shrub encroachment. Therefore mowing has been introduced at several sites as a conservation measure.
THG01;;;This dry grassland is dominated by the tussock-forming grasses such as <i>Avenula pratensis</i> and <i>Festuca ovina</i>. It supports several generalists of dry, sandy grasslands. Mosses and lichens are also common. It occurs on gentle slopes with shallow acidic soils over granite, gneiss, shale or basalt, rarely also over sandstone or sand. It is a secondary vegetation type at formerly forested sites. Traditionally it was used for low-intensity grazing, but currently most sites have been abandoned, and subsequently invaded by <i>Arrhenatherum elatius.</i> The association is relatively common on the south-eastern fringes of the Bohemian Massif, but some scattered localities are also found in northern and central Bohemia.
THG02;;;This grassland is the driest type of the alliance <i>Koelerio-Phleion</i>, occurring in areas where low precipitation is combined with predominance of acidic bedrock, mainly at the edge of the Bohemian Massif in south-western and central Moravia. It is dominated by <i>Festuca valesiaca</i> and contains several dry-grassland and sand-grassland species adapted to low pH. Mosses and lichens are common. Soils are shallow, developed on gentle slopes over granite, gneiss or decalcified sand. It is a secondary grassland type, formerly used for grazing and now mostly abandoned. Vegetation change in these very dry habitats proceeds slowly.
THG03;;;When compared with the other associations of the alliance <i>Koelerio-Phleion</i>, this grassland type occurs in slightly cooler areas. It contains less thermophilous species and is mainly composed of generalists adapted to dry and acidic soils. Mosses and lichens are common. This association is typical of gentle slopes with shallow, acidic soils over basalt, gneiss, granite or shale. It forms secondary vegetation at sites potentially supporting acidophilous oak or beech forests. These grasslands are utilized for grazing, but after abandonment they decline due to spread of tall grasses, shrubs and trees. The localities of this association are scattered in moderately dry areas of the Bohemian Massif.
THH01;;;This community is dominated by the clonal herb <i>Geranium sanguineum</i>, accompanied by other broad-leaved thermophilous herbs. It is found in warm, dry areas such as northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia, usually on steep, south-facing slopes. The soils supporting this vegetation type are mostly shallow, developed over limestone, marlstone and basalt, occasionally also over base-poor siliceous bedrock. At many sites the <i>Geranium sanguineum</i> stands occur in partial shade. At some sites it is the natural vegetation on the forest-steppe ecotone, but occurrences along the anthropogenic forest-steppe interface seem to be more common.
THH02;;;This thermophilous vegetation type is dominated by the tall herb <i>Dictamnus albus</i>, accompanied by several broad-leaved herbs typical of semi-dry grasslands and the understorey of thermophilous oak forests. It is usually found on steep, south-facing slopes in the warm, dry areas of northern and central Bohemia and southern Moravia. The bedrocks are usually base-rich, including limestone, basalt or loess. This association is linked to thermophilous oak forests, occurring along both natural and secondary forest edges.
THH03;;;This is a vegetation type of warm and dry areas, dominated by the tall herb <i>Peucedanum cervaria</i>, characterized by species composition similar to the grasslands of the <i>Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati</i>. It occurs on gentle slopes covered by deep calcareous soils, usually over marl, marlstone, loess, calcareous sandstone or limestone. <i>Peucedanum cervaria</i> stands typically develop from abandoned semi-dry grasslands of the <i>Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati</i> and may appear stable for several decades. If mowing is resumed, they may revert to vegetation dominated by grasses and other herbs. This association is distributed in lowlands and adjacent colline landscapes, especially in northern, central and eastern Bohemia and southern Moravia.
THI01;;;This closed herbaceous community is dominated by <i>Trifolium medium</i> and composed of species of mesic meadows and semi-dry grasslands. It is scattered across the higher colline landscapes and submontane areas, where it occurs mainly on gentle slopes and deeper soils. It is typical of forest edges, verges of forest roads and abandoned mesic meadows or semi-dry grasslands. The community occurs in habitats potentially supporting oak-hornbeam or beech forests throughout the country, but its distribution is not sufficiently known.
THI02;;;This herbaceous community is dominated by <i>Melampyrum nemorosum</i> and contains species of mesic meadows and those typical of the understorey of mesic broad-leaved forests. It is widespread in cooler and wetter colline landscapes, and occasionally occurs also in submontane areas. It occupies sites of potential oak-hornbeam or beech forests and often occurs in canopy openings or along the edges of these forests. The community has a scattered distribution throughout the country, but its true extent is still not sufficiently known.
VAA01;;;This association is formed of species-poor to monospecific stands of <i>Lemna trisulca</i>, a submerged plant freely floating below the water surface. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic still water bodies, especially in oxbows and alluvial pools with clear water. It avoids water bodies with deep layers of organic silt on the bottom. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in lowlands and colline areas, with a remarkable concentration of localities in the river floodplains.
VAA02;;;This association includes open to fully closed stands of <i>Lemna minor</i>, a tiny plant floating on the water surface. Often these stands are monospecific. <i>Lemna minor</i> has a broad ecological range, being most common in eutrophic water bodies. It occupies most types of water bodies except very large ones, where it is disturbed by wave action. In the Czech Republic <i>Lemnetum minoris </i>is the most common association of aquatic macrophytes, occurring mainly in the lowlands and at mid-altitudes.
VAA03;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Lemna turionifera</i>, a tiny plant freely floating on the water surface. Its stands are usually monospecific or mixed with other lemnids<i>. </i>Sometimes, especially in autumn, the stands of <i>L. turionifera </i>have a purple colour. <i>Lemna turionifera </i>is a neophyte of North American origin, which was first recorded in the Czech Republic in the 1990s. This association has been recorded at a few sites with shallow still water, but its distribution in the country is probably larger than recorded, because <i>L. turionifera </i>may have been mistaken for <i>L. minor</i> at many sites.
VAA04;;;This vegetation type is characterized by <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i>, a tiny lemnid floating on the water surface, which is frequently accompanied by <i>Lemna minor</i>. It occurs in different types of eutrophic to hypertrophic water bodies with still or slowly moving water, across the Czech Republic except mountain areas. In places the stands can completely cover the water surface.
VAA05;;;This association includes open to closed stands of <i>Lemna gibba</i>, a tiny species freely floating on the water surface. Its stands are slightly shiny and lighter green than those of other lemnids. It occurs in eutrophic to hypertrophic water bodies, often with high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and even chlorides. In the Czech Republic it is most common in warm lowlands, but it tends to spread with increasing eutrophication, even to higher altitudes.
VAA06;;;This association includes stands with <i>Wolffia arrhiza</i>, a tiny lemnid species, which is usually accompanied by other lemnids. It occurs in alluvial pools, oxbows and channels in broad river floodplains, but it avoids artificial water bodies such as fishponds. <i>Wolffia arrhiza </i>is a thermophilous species occurring rarely in the floodplains of the lower Dyje and Morava rivers in southern Moravia.
VAA07;;;This association includes vegetation with the water fern <i>Salvinia natans</i>, which freely floats on the water surface. It is usually accompanied by lemnid species, and the proportion of cover of <i>Salvinia </i>versus lemnids broadly varies from place to place. In the Czech Republic, it occurs only in mesotrophic to eutrophic fishponds, although historically it has been also recorded in oxbows. It is thermophilous vegetation, which has never been common in the country. Natural occurrences are in the lowlands around Ostrava in north-western Moravia.
VAA08;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Azolla filiculoides</i>, a thermophilous water fern of North American origin. It forms both open stands containing some lemnid species and dense stands, which entirely cover the water surface and may include several overlapping layers of the dominant species. In autumn these stands are remarkable owing to their purple to reddish colour. In the Czech Republic, vegetation with <i>A. filiculoides </i>has been so far only recorded in three small ponds inside villages.
VAA09;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Riccia fluitans</i>, a submerged liverwort, which occurs in oligo-mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic water bodies. It is often accompanied by other species requiring clear water, such as <i>Lemna trisulca </i>and <i>Utricularia australis</i>. The association occurs in small ponds and abandoned, flooded sand pits or stone quarries. In the past it also occurred in alluvial pools and oxbows, but it became rare in such habitats due to eutrophication. This vegetation has scattered localities across the Czech Republic, and it is currently more common at mid-altitudes, where more water bodies with clean water have been preserved.
VAA10;;;This association includes stands dominated by <i>Riccia rhenana</i>, a submerged aquatic liverwort. Compared with <i>R. fluitans</i>, this species is less sensitive to eutrophication. This association accordingly occurs in more eutrophic water bodies such as alluvial pools, oxbows and fishponds. In the Czech Republic it is most common in lowland and colline areas.
VAA11;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Ricciocarpos natans</i>, a small liverwort floating on the water surface, which is often accompanied by lemnid species. The association is confined to mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic water bodies such as alluvial pools, oxbows and fishponds. It is found at scattered sites from the lowlands to cool colline areas across the Czech Republic.
VAB01;;;This association is dominated by <i>Utricularia vulgaris</i>, a submerged, freely floating bladderwort. It occupies shallow mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, calcium-rich alluvial pools or pools within fen complexes, which are in an advanced stage of terrestrialization and contain a deep layer of organic sediment at their bottom. In the Czech Republic this association occurs rarely in the middle Labe area.
VAB02;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Utricularia australis</i>, a submerged, free-floating bladderwort. It occurs in mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic water bodies such as small fishponds, alluvial pools and oxbows, but it can be also found in flooded sand pits and newly established fishponds. It is scattered across the Czech Republic, with most localities in forested colline areas, which still contain many habitats with clear water.
VAC01;;;This vegetation type, dominated by <i>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae</i>, occurs in shallow water bodies with mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, still or slow-moving water such as that of oxbows, alluvial pools, fishpond margins, flooded sand pits in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, or channels. It is found in lowlands and colline areas of the Czech Republic, most frequently in the floodplains of large lowland rivers, such as the lower Vltava, middle Labe, lower Dyje and lower Morava.
VAC02;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Stratiotes aloides</i>, whose rosettes of serrate leaves float on the water surface in late spring and summer. In autumn they sink to the bottom where they overwinter. <i>Stratiotetum aloidis </i>occurs in water bodies in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, with mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, still or slow-moving water. It used to be a typical vegetation type of oxbows; now it is found in restored alluvial pools and channels in the floodplain of the lower Dyje river in southern Moravia. Here the population of <i>Stratiotes aloides </i>is native, but it declined in the past and was locally re-introduced from material of regional origin. Other localities in the Czech Republic originated from introductions of plant material of unknown origin.
VAC03;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Ceratophyllum demersum</i>, a submerged aquatic macrophyte, the morphology of which is variable depending on the degree of habitat shading and the type of sediment on the bottom. It occurs in shallow water bodies with still or slowly running, eutrophic to hypertrophic water, e.g. in small fishponds, fish-storage ponds, oxbows, channels and flooded sand pits. Due to its ability to grow in turbid water, it tends to spread in habitats affected by anthropogenic eutrophication. It is common across the lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic.
VAC04;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Ceratophyllum submersum</i>, a submerged aquatic macrophyte, which produces large amounts of biomass and often fills in the entire water column. It is found in shallow still water bodies that are well-insolated and warm in summer, e.g. small fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools and flooded sand pits. The water in these habitats is mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic and usually rich in calcium. This association occurs in lowland and warm colline areas of the Czech Republic.
VBA01;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Nuphar lutea</i>, which usually has large leaves that float on the water surface, but in flowing or deep still water it produces only submerged leaves. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic water of oxbows, alluvial pools, channels and lentic sections of streams, but it is rare in fishponds. Most often it is found at water depths of 50&ndash;150 cm, but it tolerates even strong fluctuations of the water level. In the Czech Republic in occurs mainly in the floodplains of large lowland rivers.
VBA02;;;This association includes aquatic vegetation dominated by <i>Nymphaea alba</i>, which is often accompanied by <i>Nuphar lutea</i>. It is confined to mesotrophic to eutrophic oxbows and alluvial pools with limited fluctuations of the water table, which are usually 50&ndash;100 cm deep. It does not occur in flowing water. In the terrestrialization successional series it replaces vegetation of submerged macrophytes and significantly contributes to water body filling by its high biomass production. In the Czech Republic it used to be distributed in the floodplains of lowland rivers, but it significantly declined due to river regulations in the last decades.
VBA03;;;This association includes open stands of <i>Nymphaea candida</i>, which occur in oligo-mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic, in places also dystrophic water. It is most common in fishponds with low-intensity management and alluvial water bodies in colline to submontane landscapes. It does not tolerate complete drainage of the water body. Vegetation with <i>N. candida </i>is a component of natural successional series in water bodies, however, succession in oligo-mesotrophic water bodies is rather slow. In the Czech Republic, localities of this vegetation type are scattered mainly at mid-altitudes of the Bohemian Massif, but it also occurs in the floodplain of the middle Labe river.
VBA04;;;This association includes species-poor aquatic vegetation dominated by <i>Nuphar pumila</i>, occurring in oligo-mesotrophic to mesotrophic water bodies, especially fishponds with low-intensity management and oxbows in the floodplains of upper river courses. <i>Nuphar pumila </i>appears only in the advanced stages of terrestrialization, when the bottom is covered with organic sediment. This rare vegetation type occurs only in the upper Vltava floodplain in the &#353;umava Mountains and the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands. Historical records are also from the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin.
VBA05;;;This association is dominated by <i>Trapa natans</i>, an annual aquatic macrophyte rooted in the bottom, but producing most biomass on the water surface. It occurs in eutrophic water bodies such as oxbows and fishponds. Its occurrence can be ephemeral, but on sites with more permanent occurrence it significantly contributes to terrestrialization. Due to its edible seeds <i>T. natans </i>was probably introduced by humans to various areas outside its natural range. In the Czech Republic it occurs in southern and eastern Bohemia and lowland areas of Moravia.
VBA06;;;This association, dominated by <i>Nymphoides peltata</i>, occurs in lowland eutrophic fishponds, but historical records are also from oxbows, alluvial pools and mesotrophic water bodies. It occurs in 50&ndash;150 cm deep water, but tolerates drops of the water table to the level of the bottom and indeed requires such drops for seed germination. It grows in water bodies with mineral bottom, therefore it is common in early successional stages but it declines with accumulation of organic sediments. Its localities are scattered in warm areas across the country, but in many historical localities this vegetation type disappeared due to strong eutrophication, terrestrialization and changes in fishpond management. At the same time, <i>N. peltata </i>has been introduced as a decorative plant to several fishponds even in cooler areas.
VBA07;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Persicaria amphibia</i>, which forms usually open stands with leaves floating on the water surface. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic water bodies with still or slowly moving water, e.g. at the margins of fishponds and water reservoirs, in fish storage ponds, flooded sand pits, channels, oxbows and other types of alluvial pools, and lentic sections of streams. It is associated with both early and late stages of terrestrialization. The dominant species is well adapted to habitat desiccation; in such conditions, it occurs in a terrestrial growth form. Localities of this association are scattered across the Czech Republic from the lowlands to mountain areas.
VBB01;;;This species-poor vegetation type is dominated by <i>Potamogeton natans</i>, which forms dense stands of broad leaves floating on the water surface. It occurs mostly in mesotrophic, but also in oligotrophic or eutrophic water bodies with 20&ndash;100 cm deep, still or slowly moving water, e.g. in small fishponds, pools in quarries and sand pits, oxbows, alluvial pools, channels, and lentic sections of streams. <i>Potamogeton natans </i>often appears in the early stages of terrestrialization, but it grows slowly and forms extensive stands only in the later successional stages. This association occurs from the lowlands to mountain areas across the Czech Republic.
VBB02;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Potamogeton gramineus</i>, which has both broad leaves floating on the water surface and narrow submerged leaves. In some stands natant leaves can be absent, and in such cases the plants are entirely submerged. This association is typical of shallow mesotrophic water bodies with a mineral bottom, mainly fishponds but also flooded depressions and alluvial pools. It disappears in later successional stages characterized by mud accumulation. This is a rare vegetation type in the Czech Republic.
VBB03;;;This vegetation forms small stands dominated by <i>Potamogeton polygonifolius</i>, which possesses both natant and submerged leaves. In mires, this species can occur in a terrestrial growth form without submerged leaves. It occurs in oligotrophic to mesotrophic, usually 5&ndash;20 cm deep water of submontane brooks and fishpond margins with peat accumulation. This association has an oceanic distribution range in Europe, and in the Czech Republic it occurs only at a few sites in the westernmost part of the country.
VBB04;;;This association includes stands of <i>Potamogeton lucens</i>, a submerged, broad-leaved species, which occurs in clear, mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic water, usually 50&ndash;100 cm deep, with an accumulation of organic sediment on the bottom. Its habitats include fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools, flooded sand pits in advanced successional stages, and lentic sections of streams. This vegetation type is scattered across the Czech Republic, but it has disappeared from many localities, mainly due to intensification of fishpond management and increase in water turbidity.
VBB05;;;This vegetation type is dominated by submerged species <i>Potamogeton perfoliatus</i>. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic rivers, rarely also in flooded sand and loam pits, at water depths of 50&ndash;200 cm. In the past it was also recorded in some fishponds. It is typical of early stages of terrestrialization, which are characterized by a mineral bottom with stones and gravel. In the Czech Republic this is a rare vegetation type, occurring mainly in some sections of the Labe, Vltava and Oh&#345;e rivers.
VBB06;;;This species-poor vegetation type is dominated by <i>Elodea canadensis</i>, a neophyte of North American origin, which was introduced to the Czech Republic in the second half of 19th century. Its biomass is usually concentrated in deeper parts of the water column, and therefore this species requires good water transparency. It occurs in eutrophic water bodies such as fishponds, fish storage ponds, flooded sand pits, oxbows, channels and lentic sections of streams. The water in these habitats is usually 20&ndash;70 cm deep, but does not recede to expose the bottom. <i>Elodeetum canadensis</i> occurs across the lowland to submontane areas of the Czech Republic, but in recent decades it has been on the decline at some lowland sites due to an increase in water turbidity.
VBB07;;;This vegetation type is dominated by the submerged species <i>Myriophyllum spicatum</i>, which has a broad ecological range, but it is most common in places with regular disturbance or in early successional stages. It is one of the most common aquatic associations in the middle and lower river courses and it also frequently occurs in flooded sand pits, fishponds, oxbows and channels. Water can be turbid; it is usually 20&ndash;100 cm deep, but <i>M. spicatum</i> tolerates the drying out of its habitat for some period in summer. This association is common across the lowland and mid-altitude areas of the Czech Republic.
VBB08;;;This vegetation type, dominated by <i>Myriophyllum verticillatum</i>, a submerged species, occurs in mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, clear water, e.g. in oxbows and other types of alluvial pools, small fishponds, channels and lentic sections of streams. In contrast to stands of <i>M. spicatum</i>, it occurs in habitats in an advanced stage of terrestrialization, while it is absent in recently established, and rare in man-made water bodies. It is an uncommon vegetation type in the Czech Republic.
VBB09;;;The dominant species of this association, <i>Potamogeton alpinus</i>, has submerged, and in some cases also natant leaves. It occurs mainly in brooks, upper sections of rivers, fishponds and flooded loam pits, usually in a depth of 20&ndash;60 cm. Its habitats are usually in an advanced stage of terrestrialization. The water is oligotrophic to mesotrophic, in some cases also eutrophic, but always clear. This association is scattered in the mid-altitude areas of the Czech Republic, but in recent decades it has been on the decline on many sites due to eutrophication.
VBB10;;;This association is dominated by <i>Groenlandia densa</i>, a submerged aquatic species. In the Czech Republic it occurs at a single site near Kutn&aacute; Hora in central Bohemia, where it is found in a small fishpond with clayey bottom overlaid by a layer of organic mud, at a water depth of 50 cm.
VBB11;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Potamogeton nodosus</i>, a species which possesses both natant and submerged leaves, but the former may be absent in flowing water and the latter in warm, still, turbid water. It occurs in slow-moving rivers, artificial channels or flooded sand pits, but is absent from fishponds. These habitats are usually in an early successional stage or frequently disturbed, with mineral rather than organic sediments on the bottom. Water depth is usually between 30 and 60 cm. It is a rare vegetation type in the Czech Republic, occurring mainly in some sections of lowland river corridors.
VBB12;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Potamogeton praelongus</i>, a submerged aquatic macrophyte. It occurs in oligotrophic to mesotrophic water at depths of 20&ndash;120 cm, specifically in the lentic sections of rivers and in oxbows. In the Czech Republic it occurs naturally only at a few sites in eastern Bohemia. Historically it was recorded in Prague, and it was introduced in the Koko&#345;&iacute;nsko area.
VBB13;;;This association includes stands of <i>Potamogeton .angustifolius</i>, a stable hybrid of <i>P. gramineus </i>and <i>P. lucens</i>, which possesses large submerged leaves, and often also natant leaves. The parent species and some other aquatic macropytes may also occur in these stands. The association has been recorded only at two sites in eastern Bohemia, both in small fishponds with mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic water, at depths of 10&ndash;60 cm.
VBB14;;;This association includes monodominant stands of <i>Zannichellia palustris </i>or mixed stands of this species with <i>Potamogeton pectinatus </i>and/or <i>P. pusillus</i>. All of these species have narrow, submerged leaves. They occur in eutrophic to hypertrophic, often turbid, shallow water, e.g. at fishpond margins, fish storage ponds, alluvial pools, flooded sand pits, rarely also in small streams with slowly running water. For long periods in summer they may survive in shallow (up to 1 cm deep) puddles. This association is common in warm areas of the Czech Republic.
VBB15;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Potamogeton trichoides</i>, a submerged aquatic macrophyte, which occurs in mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic, calcium-rich, clear water, particularly in small fishponds, and less frequently in alluvial pools, oxbows, flooded sand pits and slow-moving water. Its localities are scattered in lowlands and colline landscapes across the Czech Republic. The occurrence of <i>P. trichoides </i>in individual localities is often ephemeral, and in recent decades this species has slightly decreased because of eutrophication.
VBB16;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Najas marina</i>, a submerged aquatic species growing in dense stands on the bottom of still water bodies, and rarely of streams. It occurs mainly in man-made habitats in early successional stages such as fishponds and flooded sand pits. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic, calcium-rich, often brackish water, which is on average deeper than that in sites with occurrences of <i>N. minor </i>(most often 0.4&ndash;1.2 m). This vegetation type occurs at scattered sites in the Czech lowlands and in colline landscapes.
VBB17;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Najas minor</i>, a submerged macrophyte species, which may grow across the entire water column. It is found in mesotrophic to eutrophic, calcium-rich water, often with elevated concentration of chlorides, especially in fishponds, fish storage ponds, alluvial pools, and flooded pits in river floodplains. These water bodies are usually 20&ndash;50 cm deep and frequently contain a layer of organic mud on the bottom. In the Czech Republic this is a rare, ephemeral association, so far recorded in the &#268;esk&eacute; Bud&#283;jovice Basin, southernmost Moravia, and the Ostrava region.
VBB18;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Potamogeton crispus</i>, a submerged aquatic macrophyte occurring in both lentic and lotic water bodies, most frequently in fishponds, flooded sand pits, oxbows and alluvial pools, usually up to 1 m deep. This association is typical of eutrophic to hypertrophic water, including water containing organic or toxic pollutants. It is common from lowland to submontane areas across the Czech Republic.
VBB19;;;This association is dominated by the narrow-leaved, submerged species <i>Potamogeton obtusifolius</i>, which is accompanied in some sites by another narrow-leaved species, <i>P. acutifolius</i>&aacute;. It occurs in mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, clear, 30&ndash;150 cm deep water. The habitats include small fishponds, oxbows, alluvial pools, flooded sand pits, brooks and lentic sections of rivers. It is a rare vegetation type, which occurs at scattered sites from the lowlands to submontane areas in the Czech Republic, and has retreated in the past decades due to intensification of fishpond management and increased water turbidity.
VBB20;;;This association is dominated by <i>Potamogeton pectinatus</i>, a submerged macrophyte with a variable growth form, which depends on the habitat. It occurs in eutrophic and hypertrophic water, often with high turbidity, and on some sites with a high salt concentration. The habitats include mainly fishponds and middle and lower river courses, and less frequently fish storage ponds, alluvial pools, channels and flooded sand pits. Water depth is usually between 30 and 100 cm, but it can be as low as 5 cm. Historically this vegetation type was probably rare, but it expanded due to intensification of fishpond management and eutrophication in the second half of the 20th century. It is common in lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic, but records are probably missing from many areas where it occurs.
VBB21;;;This vegetation include species-poor submerged stands of <i>Potamogeton berchtoldii </i>or <i>P. pusillus</i>, which often grow across the entire water column. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic, clear water of varying depth, particularly in shallow parts of fishponds, in fish storage ponds, flooded sand pits and quarries, and in channels and rivers, especially along their lower courses. These habitats are usually either disturbed or in an early stage of succession. This association is common from the lowlands to submontane areas across the Czech Republic.
VBB22;;;This association is dominated by <i>Potamogeton acutifolius</i>, a submerged narrow-leaved species, which is in places accompanied by other narrow-leaved <i>Potamogeton </i>species or other aquatic macrophytes. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic, often calcium-rich, clear water at depths up to 1 m, including less intensively managed fishponds, channels, flooded sand pits and sylvan pools. In the Czech Republic it is a rare association, which has been recorded at a few sites in lowland and colline landscapes.
VBB23;;;This species-poor association is dominated by <i>Potamogeton friesii</i>, a submerged macrophyte. In the Czech Republic it was historically recorded at a few sites in mesotrophic fishponds, pools and in a water reservoir. Currently this species and association is probably extinct in this country.
VBC01;;;This species-poor vegetation type is dominated by <i>Batrachium fluitans</i>, or less frequently by <i>B. penicillatum</i>. Both species form tussocks of long stems with submerged leaves in running water. Some other species of running water may also occur, such as the aquatic moss <i>Fontinalis antipyretica</i>. They occur in the upper and middle reaches of streams, including some artificial channels, with fast-running, cool, clear and nutrient-poor water 10&ndash;60(&ndash;100) cm deep. The habitats are well insolated and have stony or gravelly bottoms. This vegetation type has scattered occurrences especially at the middle altitudes of the Bohemian Massif.
VBC02;;;This association includes stands of <i>Myriophyllum alterniflorum</i>, a submerged aquatic macrophyte occurring in oligo-mesotrophic to dystrophic streams with clear water. In contrast to the association <i>Ranunculetum fluitantis</i>, it is confined to lentic sections of streams with sandy to gravelly bottoms, at depths of 10&ndash;60(&ndash;100) cm. In the Czech Republic <i>Myriophylletum alterniflori</i> occurs only in the upper and middle Vltava river in southern Bohemia.
VBC03;;;This association is dominated by <i>Callitriche hamulata</i>, which usually occurs in a submerged growth form, but in places with exposed bottoms it can also occur in a terrestrial growth form. Habitats include brooks, channels, upper and middle river courses, and less frequently also small fishponds, fish storage ponds and oxbows. Water is cool and oligotrophic to mesotrophic, in places even dystrophic. Bottom is usually sandy to clayey. This vegetation type is common in cool submontane areas of the Czech Republic, but it is poorly documented.
VBD01;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Batrachium aquatile</i> or <i>B. peltatum</i>, aquatic macrophytes with both submerged and natant leaves. Depending on the habitat, one of these two leaf types can be reduced or absent. The association occurs in shallow, seasonal or permanent, mesotrophic to eutrophic water bodies such as fishponds, flooded sand or loam pits, fish storage ponds, oxbows and channels. It also occurs in middle to lower river courses with medium to low current velocity. Habitats are usually well insolated and water is up to 1 m deep. In the Czech Republic this association occurs mainly in colline to submontane areas.
VBD02;;;This association is dominated by <i>Batrachium trichophyllum</i>, an aquatic macrophyte with thread-like submerged leaves. It occurs in oligo-mesotrophic to eutrophic water bodies such as small fishponds, alluvial pools and ditches. It tolerates high water turbidity. In the Czech Republic this vegetation type is rather common, but there are few reliable records due to the difficulty in accurately identifying species of water crowfoots (<i>Batrachium</i>).
VBD03;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Batrachium circinatum</i>, an aquatic macrophyte which possesses only submerged leaves. It occurs in mesotrophic to naturally eutrophic, still, clear and well insolated water which rarely or never dries out. Habitats include fishponds, flooded sand or loam pits, deep oxbows and alluvial pools in early stages of terrestrialization. This association occurs in lowland and colline areas, but it is not common due to its requirements for high water transparency.
VBD04;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Batrachium rionii</i>, an aquatic macrophyte with submerged leaves, which forms open stands with less biomass than typically produced by other <i>Batrachium </i>species. It occurs in shallow, warm fishpond margins and pools at depths of 20&ndash;60 cm. Water is naturally eutrophic, with elevated salt concentrations. It is a rare vegetation type confined to warm areas, recorded in central Bohemia and southernmost Moravia.
VBD05;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Batrachium baudotii</i>, an aquatic macrophyte with both submerged and natant leaves. It occurs in eutrophic water bodies, often with a high salt concentration, which are well insolated and dry out in summer. In the Czech Republic, this is a rare community, which has been recorded only in small fishponds and shallow periodic wetlands and channels in the warm areas of southernmost Moravia.
VBD06;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Hottonia palustris</i>, which has submerged leaves and conspicuous flowers above the water surface. In habitats which dry out in summer this species occurs in a terrestrial growth form. It occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic still water up to 50 cm deep, including in oxbows, alluvial pools, channels, periodically flooded ditches and sand pits. It is rare in fishponds. Occurrences are scattered throughout the warm areas of the Czech Republic.
VBD07;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Callitriche hermaphroditica</i>, an aquatic macrophyte that is a weak competitor, and which forms only submerged stands. Historical records of this association are from a few fishponds with cool, oligotrophic to mesotrophic water in eastern Bohemia and the &#382;&#271;&aacute;rsk&eacute; vrchy Hills. Currently it is only known from Mal&eacute; D&aacute;&#345;ko fishpond in the &#382;&#271;&aacute;rsk&eacute; vrchy Hills.
VCA01;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Nitella flexilis</i>. It occurs in clear, oligotrophic to mesotrophic water bodies, such as fishponds with low-intensity management, oxbows and flooded stone quarries. Occurrences are scattered across the cooler parts of Bohemia.
VCA02;;;This association is dominated by <i>Chara braunii</i>, occurring in mesotrophic to eutrophic water. Relev&eacute;s have so far been recorded at only three sites in southern Bohemia and one site in southern Moravia. The habitats were fishponds and fish storage ponds.
VCB01;;;This association is dominated by <i>Chara globularis</i>, a stonewort species with a broad ecological range. It occurs mainly in man-made water bodies such as fishponds with less intensive management, sand pits and fish storage ponds, usually in water less than 50 cm deep. It has been documented in different parts of the Czech Republic, mainly at low altitudes.
VCB02;;;This vegetation type, dominated by <i>Chara hispida</i>, occurs in small unmanaged or less intensively managed fishponds and flooded sand or loam pits. It has also been documented from a natural habitat of pools within a calcareous fen complex near Lys&aacute; nad Labem. It grows in water with a higher concentration of calcium than typical of other stonewort associations. This association has been so far recorded at a few sites in warm lowlands of northern and central Bohemia.
VCB03;;;This vegetation, dominated by <i>Chara vulgaris</i>, occurs in fishponds, flooded sand pits, oxbows, alluvial pools, shallow pools in wet arable fields, ditches or fish storage ponds, even those with concrete bottoms. The dominant species has a broader ecological range than the other Czech stonewort species; it tolerates pollution, disturbance and periodical water drawdowns. It is capable of rapid colonization of suitable habitats, e.g. newly established or recently dredged water bodies. This is accordingly the most common association of the class <i>Charetea </i>in the Czech Republic. It has been recorded in several localities in lowland and colline areas.
VCB04;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Tolypella glomerata</i>, a stonewort species which grows taller in calcium-rich water but becomes stunted in calcium-poor environments. The association <i>Tolypelletum glomeratae </i>has so far been recorded at only three sites in the Czech Republic, including a small fishpond, a shallow ditch along a road and a hollow dug-out in a meadow.
VCB05;;;Vegetation dominated by <i>Tolypella intricata</i> occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic, base-rich water. In the Czech Republic it has so far been recorded only at three sites in central and eastern Bohemia, namely in small fishponds and in a flooded pit.
VDA01;;;This association is represented by a single monospecific stand of <i>Isoëtes echinospora</i> on the bottom of Ple&#353;n&eacute; Lake at an altitude of 1087 m in the &#353;umava Mountains. It occurs mainly at depths of 30&ndash;50 cm, rarely up to 75 cm. The lake is situated on granite bedrock and its water is mesotrophic. Due to acid rain, lake water has not exceeded pH 5 since the 1960s, which has caused an increase in toxic aluminium concentrations and restricted regeneration of <i>Isoëtes</i>. However, in recent years water chemistry has improved and regeneration of <i>Isoëtes</i> resumed after 2005.
VDA02;;;This association includes a single monospecific stand of <i>Isoëtes lacustris </i>on the bottom of &#268;ern&eacute; Lake at an altitude of 1008 m in the &#353;umava Mountains. It occurs mainly in depths of 1&ndash;4 m. The lake is situated on mica schist bedrock. Lake water is naturally oligotrophic and acidic, but its pH decreased below 5 due to acid rain in the 1960s&ndash;1990s. Although water chemistry has begun to slowly improve, concentrations of toxic aluminium remain high and the <i>Isoëtes </i>population does not reproduce in this lake.
VDB01;;;This low-growing grassland-like vegetation type is dominated by <i>Littorella uniflora </i>and often codominated by <i>Eleocharis acicularis</i>. When flooded, it is poor in species, but annual wetland herbs appear on exposed bottom after water drawdown. This vegetation occurs in the littoral zone of a few oligotrophic to mesotrophic fishponds and water bodies in the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands, T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin and the Brdy Mountains.
VDB02;;;This association includes stands of low-growing perennial amphibious herbs, dominated by <i>Juncus bulbosus </i>and <i>Ranunculus flammula</i>. It occurs in the littoral zones of lakes, fishponds, water reservoirs, flooded sand pits, hollows after peat extraction and ditches along forest roads. It is periodically flooded by oligotrophic to mesotrophic, rarely dystrophic water, which can reach depths up to 25 cm. It occurs in the colline to submontane belts of Bohemia and western Moravia.
VDB03;;;This association includes low-growing, species-poor vegetation dominated by <i>Eleocharis acicularis</i>. It occurs in shallow, seasonally desiccating water bodies such as in the littoral zones of lakes, fishponds and water reservoirs, fish storage ponds, ponds in sand pits, oxbows and littoral zones of large rivers. The water in these habitats is usually mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic and bottoms are sandy or gravelly. This vegetation type occurs in various fishpond areas of the Czech Republic, being most common in southern Bohemia and the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands.
VDB04;;;This vegetation type is dominated by the tiny wetland fern <i>Pilularia globulifera</i>, which forms dense low-growing stands in shallow oligotrophic to mesotrophic water bodies with fluctuating water table. It was recorded in two fishponds in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin in the 1930s, but disappeared soon afterwards. A new locality was found in the year 2007 in the Karhov fishpond near Studen&aacute; in the Jihlavsk&eacute; vrchy Mountains.
VDB05;;;This association is formed of monospecific stands of <i>Luronium natans</i>, an aquatic macrophyte with leaves floating on the water table. The only two Czech localities of this species and association are found in a mesotrophic, lightly managed fishpond and a water tank in the Elbe sandstone area in northern Bohemia.
VDC01;;;This is vegetation of dystrophic to mesotrophic bog pools with <i>Sparganium natans</i>, accompanied by <i>Utricularia intermedia. U. minor</i> and <i>U. ochroleuca</i>. It can also occur in nutrient-poor, man-made habitats, such as flooded hollows after peat extraction, littoral zone of oligotrophic fishponds or pools in sand pits. It occurs in deeper water than the other associations of the alliance <i>Sphagno-Utricularion</i>, but can nevertheless easily survive occasional drops of the water table and exposure of the bottom. Scattered localities of this rare vegetation type occur in various parts of Bohemia.
VDC02;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Utricularia intermedia </i>and <i>U. ochroleuca</i> with a significant moss layer, which includes <i>Drepanocladus </i>spp. and <i>Sphagnum </i>spp. Its natural habitat is shallow, intermittently flooded bog pools and hollows with oligotrophic to dystrophic non-calcareous water, but it can also occur in abandoned peat extraction hollows and littoral zones of mesotrophic to oligotrophic fishponds. It occurs mainly in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin, but it has also been found rarely in other cool and precipitation-rich areas in western Bohemia.
VDC03;;;This vegetation type is dominated by submerged mosses of the family <i>Amblystegiaceae</i>, especially <i>Pseudo-calliergon trifarium. Scorpidium cossonii </i>and <i>S. scorpioides</i>, combined with <i>Utricularia minor</i>, and rarely also <i>U. intermedia</i>. It occurs in shallow hollows with mesotrophic to oligotrophic and calcium-rich water in fens and other peatlands, and in the course of succession it develops towards minerotrophic mires. In the Czech Republic it occurs rarely in precipitation-rich basins and montane areas that are rich in mires.
XAA01;;;This is a species-poor, low-growing community dominated by the creeping annual <i>Polygonum arenastrum</i>. It occurs on frequently trampled, sunny and dry sites, on various substrata. During dry periods in the summer this vegetation may be formed by monodominant stands of <i>Polygonum arenastrum</i>, but in wetter periods in spring and autumn some other annual species also appear. It is one of the most common vegetation types of trampled habitats occurring from the lowlands to submontane areas throughout the country.
XAA02;;;This thermophilous vernal community is dominated by the endangered annual grass <i>Sclerochloa dura</i>. It occurs on trampled, dry and sunny sites on dirt roads in rural landscapes, e.g. among vineyards, arable fields and in less urbanized parts of the villages. The community occurs scarcely in the warm and dry regions in northern Bohemia and southern Moravia.
XAA03;;;This rare community of trampled habitats with the endangered annual herb <i>Coronopus squamatus</i> occurs on nutrient-rich and often slightly saline soils in farmyards and areas where poultry is allowed to run free in rural areas. In the Czech Republic it occurs scarcely in lowland and colline landscapes.
XAA04;;;This thermophilous community occurs on dry and sun-exposed sites, such as sandy or gravelly soils in railway stations and along city sidewalks. Its phenological optimum is in late summer. It occurs mostly in towns in warm and dry areas of the Czech Republic.
XAB01;;;These open stands dominated by <i>Sagina procumbens </i>and the moss<i> Bryum argenteum</i> occur in mesic and often shaded habitats of paving fissures, mostly in city centres. However, it may also occur on heavily trampled loamy soils in villages. Usually it has a well developed moss layer. It is most frequent in colline and submontane areas.
XAB02;;;These open and low-growing stands dominated by <i>Herniaria glabra</i> occur on well drained gravelly or sandy soils with low content of bases and nutrients. They are typical of trampled sites at railway stations and on margins of sandy roads, but they may also develop on natural sand accumulations in river floodplains. In the Czech Republic this association is distributed in moderately cool and humid regions of colline to submontane areas.
XAB03;;;This vegetation type, dominated by <i>Spergularia rubra</i>, occurs along forest roads, on sidewalks, playgrounds, roadsides and around railway stations. Soils are sandy to rocky, poor in bases and humus; in comparison with the <i>Herniarietum glabrae </i>they usually contain coarser particles. They can dry out considerably during the summer drought periods. The vegetation has its phenological optimum in mid-summer and early autumn. It occurs in colline to submontane areas of the Bohemian Massif.
XAB04;;;This is a widespread community dominated by the annual to short-lived perennial grass <i>Poa annua</i>, and accompanied by the perennial rosette plant <i>Plantago major</i>. It usually occurs in partially shaded habitats on nutrient-rich soils with intermediate moisture availability. It is common in human settlements and their surroundings but also occurs on forest roads, paths and fishpond shores. It is widely distributed throughout the country, being most frequent in humid colline and submontane areas.
XAB05;;;Vegetation dominated by the invasive neophyte <i>Matricaria discoidea </i>occurs on occasionally trampled sites with mesic loamy soils, often with an admixture of sand or gravel. It grows on roadsides, playgrounds, sand or gravel heaps or disturbed places where poultry is allowed to run free. Unlike the other communities of the class <i>Polygono-Poëtea </i>it is more typical of initial successional stages on recently disturbed sites than of frequently trampled habitats. In the Czech Republic this community is probably frequent, but not sufficiently documented. It occurs mainly in colline and submontane landscapes.
XBA01;;;This rare association occupies the warmest and base-richest habitats of all <i>Caucalidion </i>associations in the Czech Republic. It usually grows in winter cereal fields on flat land or gentle south-facing slopes over limestone or loess. It contains several rare species of southern and south-eastern distribution which are declining in central Europe. It develops from late spring to early summer.
XBA02;;;This association occurs in cereal or oil-seed rape fields or on fallows in warm areas. Its relationships to temperature and soil base content are intermediate between the associations <i>Caucalido platycarpi-Conringietum orientalis</i> and <i>Euphorbio exiguae-Melandrietum noctiflori</i>. Soils are usually chernozems or brown soils developed on loess. Several endangered weed species occur in this vegetation type. Its phenological optimum is from late spring to early summer.
XBA03;;;This species-rich weed association is rather common in warm areas at low altitudes. It occurs in cultures of winter and summer cereals, oil-seed rape, on fallows, stubbles and occasionally in root-crop fields. Soils are usually base-rich, but in some places this vegetation type also develops on slightly acidic soils. Its phenological optimum is from late spring to early summer.
XBA04;;;This species-rich association occurs in warm areas on base-rich soils. It includes several thermophilous annual weed species which germinate only in late spring. Its phenological optimum is in August and September when it develops on stubbles, recently abandoned fields, in vineyards and root-crop fields. Several rare and endangered annual weed species occur in this vegetation type. This association of Pannonian and Balkan distribution reaches its north-western range limit in the Czech Republic.
XBA05;;;This low-growing vegetation type dominated by annual <i>Veronica </i>species occurs in winter cereal fields, vineyards and recent fallows, as well as on exposed loamy soils outside agricultural habitats. It develops from mid-March to mid-May before the crop or taller weeds form dense stands. After May it is replaced by other <i>Caucalidion </i>associations in arable habitats or by stands of taller annual herbs in ruderal habitats. It is concentrated in warm and dry areas of the Czech Republic, but also occurs in some cooler parts of the country.
XBB01;;;<i>Mercurialietum annuae </i>is the more thermophilous of the two asssociations of the alliance <i>Veronico-Euphorbion </i>occurring in the Czech Republic. It occurs in dry and warm lowlands in root-crop fields, vineyards, kitchen gardens, stubble fields and ruderal habitats. Soils are heavy, clayey to loamy and near-neutral to basic. Most species of this association are annual weeds which germinate in late spring; the phenological optimum of this association is in late summer.
XBB02;;;This association occurs both in warm and cool areas of the Czech Republic in root-crop fields, kitchen gardens or oil-seed rape cultures. It also occurs in cereal fields, especially at higher altitudes or where they are more frequently sprayed with herbicide. On some sites, particularly at lower altitudes, this community developed from other weed communities due to agricultural intensification. Soils are heavy, loamy or clayey, and base-rich. This association may develop already in spring, but its phenological optimum is in late summer.
XBC01;;;This association includes weed vegetation of winter and summer cereal fields, but it may also occur in root-crop fields on some sites. It is found on sandy-loamy to loamy, acidic soils at middle altitudes. It attains its phenological optimum in summer.
XBC02;;;Compared to the previous association, <i>Spergulo-Scleranthetum </i>occurs in cooler areas, being common in the submontane zone, although it can be also found on wet and nutrient-poor soils in the lowlands. Besides cereal fields, where it is most common, it occurs in root crop fields, oil-seed rape fields, on recent fallows and stubbles. Soils are sandy-loamy to loamy, usually cambisols, in places gleyic. This association develops in summer.
XBC03;;;<i>Erophilo-Arabidopsietum </i>is a weed or ruderal community of vernal ephemeral therophytes developing in disturbed places on slightly acidic soils. It occurs in winter-cereal fields, on recent fallows, near roads or railways or on disturbed sites in grasslands. In late May it is replaced by other associations of the alliances <i>Scleranthion annui </i>or <i>Oxalidion fontanae </i>on arable land or by vegetation of taller annual therophytes in ruderal habitats. In the Czech Republic it is widespread at middle altitudes.
XBD01;;;This association includes vegetation of field margins, fallows or open stands of cereal crops on nutrient-poor, sandy soils. It is dominated by low-growing annuals of oceanic distribution, most notably <i>Arnoseris minima </i>and <i>Teesdalia nudicaulis</i>. It is an endangered vegetation type currently found on a single site in the T&#345;ebo&#328; Basin in southern Bohemia, although there were some historical localities in western Bohemia and the middle Labe area.
XBE01;;;This association includes weed vegetation of both cereal and root-crop cultures at higher altitudes and in precipitation-rich areas. In most places it occurs on loamy and heavy soils. It can also develop on wet soils in the lowlands and occasionally even outside agricultural habitats such as on alluvial deposits. Its phenological optimum is in summer, but it can persist on the stubble fields until autumn.
XBF01;;;<i>Setario-Echinochloëtum </i>is developed in dry lowland areas on well drained sandy soils which may be irrigated in some places. Due to late germination of most of its constituent species it develops only in July and has its phenological optimum between August and September. It is found in maize, root-crop or vegetable fields, in vineyards and on stubble fields. It is common in lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic.
XBG01;;;This community is dominated by goosefoot species of the <i>Chenopodium album </i>agg., mainly <i>C. album</i> s. str., <i>C. opulifolium</i>, <i>C. pedunculare</i>, <i>C. strictum </i>and <i>C. suecicum</i>. It occurs in loamy to skeletal, base-rich, mesic to dry soils on old building rubble, refuse dumps, roadworks and on construction sites. It is an intermittent community which retreats in a few years due to either disturbances or successional changes. Dominant species germinate in late spring and reach their phenological optimum in late summer and early autumn. In the Czech Republic this is one of the most common types of ruderal vegetation in early successional stages.
XBG02;;;This community dominated by <i>Chenopodium urbicum </i>occurs on mesic to wet soils rich in calcium carbonate and nutrients. It is found on rubble of old village houses or barns, or at the edges of dung hills, often in places with dung water input. It develops from May to mid-summer. It is an archaeophytic vegetation type which has recently become very rare. It has been recorded on a few sites in warm areas of the Czech Republic.
XBG03;;;This species-poor community is dominated by the annual herb <i>Atriplex sagittata</i>, which can form stands up to 2 m tall. It develops on bare soils exposed due to construction, in settlements, around farms and on road embankments. It can occur in places with increased content of chloride salts. <i>Atriplex sagittata </i>germinates in early spring and its stands are vital until autumn. Along with the association<i> Chenopodietum stricti</i>, it is the most common vegetation type of initial stages of secondary succession in and around human settlements in the Czech Republic. It is most common in warm lowlands, but it also occurs in moderately cool areas.
XBG04;;;This community dominated by <i>Atriplex oblongifolia </i>develops in recently disturbed places, especially on dry soil heaps on construction sites, at the edges of dry grasslands or around refuse dumps. Its phenological optimum is from June to October. It occurs both in villages and city suburbs in the lowland areas of the Czech Republic.
XBG05;;;This is a species-poor community dominated by <i>Atriplex tatarica</i>, developing on loamy, sandy or skeletal soils. It occurs at railway stations, in industrial areas, on old building rubble, at refuse dumps and along roads.
XBG06;;;This vegetation type is formed of monodominant stands of <i>Atriplex rosea</i>, a critically endangered species of the Czech flora. It is found on disturbed, usually base-rich soils on roadsides, rubble of demolished buildings, mine tailings and at the bases of old village walls. In the past three decades this community has been observed on a few sites in central, northern and western Bohemia. It was more common in the mid-20th century but it was replaced by other <i>Atriplex </i>species on most of its sites.
XBG07;;;This community is dominated by <i>Sisymbrium loeselii</i>. It colonizes bare substrata such as soil heaps around construction sites and strip mines, ballast deposits and places around railway stations. Soils are sandy to loamy and rich in nutrients. The <i>Sisymbrietum loeselii </i>is similar to the <i>Descurainietum sophiae</i>, but the latter is less thermophilous. Stands of the <i>Sisymbrietum loeselii </i>attain their maximum biomass from July to October. They are found in warm areas of the Czech Republic, particularly in the city suburbs.
XBG08;;;This association is formed of stands of <i>Descurainia sophia</i>, accompanied by other tall annuals. It occurs in warm and sunny places on rubble of demolished buildings, rubbish heaps or tops of old walls. It is a vernal community that can be found until June. On certain sites it usually lasts for no more than two seasons, then giving way to perennial ruderal vegetation. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in colline areas.
XBG09;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>, accompanied by other annual plants including winter annuals, and some perennials. It occurs on sunny sites with dry, usually sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Typical habitats include roadsides, dumping grounds, disturbed sites in sand pits and around railways. This vegetation type usually appears in the second year after exposure of bare ground. Its phenological optimum is in June and July. In the Czech Republic it has scattered occurrences in warm and moderately warm areas.
XBG10;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Sisymbrium officinale </i>and includes some other annuals and species of trampled habitats. It is found on sunny to slightly shaded sites, most often in village yards, in gaps between city buildings, and on roadsides and dumping grounds. Soils are loamy, with good availability of moisture and nutrients. <i>Sisymbrium officinale </i>is a winter annual which reaches its maximum biomass in July, but it persists until autumn. It is common from lowland to submontane areas of the Czech Republic.
XBG11;;;This association is usually dominated by two species, <i>Lactuca serriola, </i>occurring in the upper layer, and <i>Conyza canadensis</i> in the lower layer. Monodominant stands of one of these two species are also common. They occur on warm and sunny sites with shallow, dry, sandy to stony, nutrient-poor soils. They are typical of initial stages of secondary succession, and are soon replaced by other vegetation types with perennial species. This type is common in lowland and colline areas of the Czech Republic, but also occurs in slightly cooler areas.
XBG12;;;This community is dominated by <i>Iva xanthiifolia</i>, a tall-growing annual neophyte of North American origin. It is typical of disturbed ruderal places, e.g. on construction sites, but it can also occur on arable land. Habitats are sunny and warm. It has been rarely recorded in some cities in warm areas of the Czech Republic.
XBG13;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Kochia scoparia</i>, a neophyte originating from Asian and south-eastern European steppes. It grows in sunny and dry places on gravel and sand heaps, waste dumps or along railway tracks. <i>Kochia scoparia </i>germinates late in the season and its stands are best developed at the end of summer and in autumn.

Currently it is common along rivers in lowland and colline areas throughout the country.
XDA04;;;This vegetation type is dominated by <i>Echinocystis lobata</i>, an annual herbaceous liana, which is accompanied by tall herbaceous, both annual and perennial, nutrient demanding species. <i>Echinocystis lobata </i>is a neophyte of North American origin. Its stands occur in regularly flooded habitats in large river floodplains, at the banks of rivers, oxbows, pools or ditches, and around fishponds. The spread of <i>Echinocystis lobata </i>in river corridors is supported by floods and probably also by river regulations. This vegetation type is documented by relev&eacute;s mainly from the Morava river floodplain in southern Moravia, but it also occurs in some other low-altitude areas of the Czech Republic.
XDB01;;;This association includes dense stands of <i>Petasites hybridus</i>, a perennial herb with large leaves. It occurs on river banks and alluviual sediments, on some sites even on gravelly deposits in the middle parts of stream channels; in these habitats it is the natural herbaceous vegetation of flood-disturbed sites.

XDE07;;;This association includes stands dominated by <i>Helianthus tuberosus</i>, a tall perennial herb which is a neophyte of North American origin. It occurs on banks and alluvia of rivers, along roads, railways, on abandoned fields, building rubble and dumping sites near settlements. It has naturalized on some forest edges or clearings where this species was originally planted as a source of game fodder. Once established on a particular site it may persist for a long time due to vegetative reproduction through an extensive rhizome system. <i>Helianthus tuberosus </i>stands are scattered across the Czech Republic, being more common in lowlands and large river corridors.
XDE08;;;This species-poor community is dominated by <i>Heracleum mantegazzianum</i>, a broad-leaved forb growing up to 4 m in height, which is a neophyte originating from the Caucasus. <i>H. mantegazzianum </i>spreads both in natural and semi-natural habitats, e.g. in abandoned meadows and orchards, on roadsides, in scrub fringes and on stream banks. Open, disturbed sites are colonized most rapidly. Soils are wet to mesic and rich in nutrients. <i>Urtico-Heracleetum </i>occurs throughout the Czech Republic, being more common in precipitation-rich areas and in the western part of the country.
XDE09;;;This association is formed of herbaceous stands dominated by species of the genus <i>Aster </i>of North American origin, namely <i>A. lanceolatus </i>and <i>A. novi-belgii</i>. They occur on ruderal sites in human settlements, e.g. on building rubble, dumping sites, along fences, on roadsides or in unmown grasslands. Often they are found in fringes of floodplain forests and on banks of streams and shores of fishponds. Relev&eacute;s with invasive <i>Aster </i>species are available mainly from southern Moravia, although this vegetation type occurs in other areas of the Czech Republic as well.
XDE10;;;This association includes species-poor stands dominated by <i>Reynoutria japonica</i> and <i>R. sachalinensis</i>, tall broad-leaved herbs of eastern Asian origin, and their hybrid <i>R. .bohemica</i>. It occurs mainly on river banks, but it is also common on roadsides, along railways, in waste places and abandoned meadows. <i>Reynoutria </i>species intensively spread to new sites via vegetative propagules and once established, they move to dominate the sites through intensive clonal growth. Invasion of <i>Reynoutria </i>species in the Czech Republic started in the middle of 20th century. Their monodominant stands are scattered to common from lowlands to submontane areas across the country. The hybrid tends to be more invasive than its parent species.
XDF01;;;This vegetation type consists of dense and species-poor stands of <i>Rumex alpinus</i>, a broad-leaved perennial neophyte introduced from the high mountain ranges of central Europe. It occurs on deep, nutrient-rich, mesic to wet soils in the areas above the timberline or in the montane belt. Most often its stands are found around mountain huts and abandoned stables. They occur in the Jizersk&eacute; hory, Krkono&#353;e and Orlick&eacute; hory Mountains.
XEA01;;;This vegetation type is characterized by rapid colonizers of disturbed sites in forest environments, such as the perennial <i>Epilobium angustifolium </i>and the annual <i>Senecio sylvaticus</i>. In successionally more developed stages, grasses such as <i>Avenella flexuosa </i>may dominate. It occurs mainly on well drained acidic soils on nutrient-poor bedrock such as granite and less frequently on nutrient-richer schists, which support stands with <i>Atropa bella-donna</i>. It is typical of deforested sites in places of former acidophilous oak or beech forests or conifer plantations on analogous sites. Other habitats include roadsides, strips of land around railways, boulder accumulations at forest edges, building ruins in forests or ski slopes.
XEA02;;;This association is dominated by <i>Digitalis purpurea</i>, a western European herb which is probably alien to the Czech Republic. <i>D. purpurea </i>has spread especially in north-western Bohemia since the 19th century. This vegetation occurs on deforested acidophilous beech forest or spruce plantation sites. Soils are wet to mesic with low pH. It is distributed mainly in the submontane to montane belts of the climatically oceanic areas of Bohemia.
XEA03;;;This association includes grasslands with <i>Calamagrostis arundinacea </i>in forest clearings, at edges of screes and on rocky slopes. It replaces different types of beech, oak, oak-hornbeam and ravine forests on rocks of intermediate nutrient status. During succession on deforested sites the stage with <i>Calamagrostis arundinacea </i>can persist for a long time. In the Czech Republic this association occurs mainly at middle altitudes, although it can rarely develop in the subalpine belt.
XEA04;;;This vegetation type is formed of dense stands of <i>Calamagrostis villosa</i> which develop on sites of natural, montane spruce forests or mixed acidophilous spruce-fir-beech forests. In forest clearings and on sites deforested due to air pollution this vegetation may inhibit further succession of trees and form a long-term persisting successional stage. Artificial afforestation on these sites is difficult too. Soils are acidic and litter decomposition processes are slow. This vegetation type is common in the mountain ranges along the Czech borders at altitudes of 700&ndash;1100 m. It may occur in frost pockets at low altitudes as well.
XEA05;;;This association includes stands of tall forbs, in particular <i>Senecio ovatus</i>. Grasses, such as <i>Calamagrostis epigejos</i>, and the shrub <i>Rubus idaeus </i>are frequently present as well. This vegetation occurs on disturbed sites in logged oak-hornbeam, eutrophic fir-beech and ravine forests, and particularly in logged spruce plantations in the corresponding habitats. It is less frequent on the sites of former acidophilous beech or oak forests. This vegetation type is common across the Czech Republic, especially at the middle altitudes.
XEA06;;;This association includes species-poor stands dominated by <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>, a tall fern with intensive vegetative spreading through underground rhizomes. It develops in logging clearings of former acidophilous oak or beech forests or pine plantations in corresponding habitats. Large stands develop particularly in the first years after forests fires. Soils are acidic and nutrient-poor, developing on sand or sandstones. In the Czech Republic this association occurs mainly in sandstone areas of northern and eastern Bohemia, but it can be also found elsewhere and outside sandy habitats.
XEA07;;;This association includes species-poor stands dominated by large ferns such as <i>Athyrium filix-femina. Dryopteris dilatata</i>, <i>D. filix-mas</i>, rarely also <i>Lastrea limbosperma</i>, which are accompanied by small ferns such as <i>Gymnocarpium dryopteris </i>and <i>Phegopteris connectilis</i>. It occurs in shaded to partially shaded habitats with moderately wet soils and high air humidity such as canopy gaps, shaded edges of clearings, forest roadsides or high banks of forest brooks. In the Czech Republic it occurs mainly in the submontane to montane belt, chiefly in the Bohemian sandstone areas, but also elsewhere.
